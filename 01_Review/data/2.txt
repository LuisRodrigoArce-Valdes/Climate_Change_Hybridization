A Comprehensive and Dated Phylogenomic Analysis of Butterflies	CURRENT BIOLOGY			English	Article							SPECIES TREES; COMPLETE GENOMES; LEPIDOPTERA; GENE; DIVERSIFICATION; CLASSIFICATION; EVOLUTION; INSECT; MOTHS; BIOGEOGRAPHY	Butterflies (Papilionoidea), with over 18,000 described species [1], have captivated naturalists and scientists for centuries. They play a central role in the study of speciation, community ecology, biogeography, climate change, and plant-insect interactions and include many model organisms and pest species [2, 3]. However, a robust higher-level phylogenetic framework is lacking. To fill this gap, we inferred a dated phylogeny by analyzing the first phylogenomic dataset, including 352 loci (> 150,000 bp) from 207 species representing 98% of tribes, a 35-fold increase in gene sampling and 3-fold increase in taxon sampling over previous studies [4]. Most data were generated with a new anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) [5] gene kit (BUTTERFLY1.0) that includes both new and frequently used (e.g., [6]) informative loci, enabling direct comparison and future dataset merging with previous studies. Butterflies originated around 119 million years ago (mya) in the late Cretaceous, but most extant lineages diverged after the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass-extinction 65 mya. Our analyses support swallowtails (Papilionidae) as sister to all other butterflies, followed by skippers (Hesperiidae) + the nocturnal butterflies (Hedylidae) as sister to the remainder, indicating a secondary reversal from diurnality to nocturnality. The whites (Pieridae) were strongly supported as sister to brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae) and blues + metalmarks (Lycaenidae and Riodinidae). Ant association independently evolved once in Lycaenidae and twice in Riodinidae. This study overturns prior notions of the taxon's evolutionary history, as many long-recognized subfamilies and tribes are para-or polyphyletic. It also provides a much-needed backbone for a revised classification of butterflies and for future comparative studies including genome evolution and ecology.

We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality. Conclusions Temperature extremes and changes to climatic norms may have a dramatic effect on venomous terrestrial species. As climate change affects the distribution, populations, and life histories of these organisms, the chance	[Needleman, Robert K.] Cook Cty Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Chicago, IL 60612 USA; [Neylan, Isabelle P.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC USA; [Erickson, Timothy] Harvard Humanitarian Initiat, Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Div Med Toxicol,Dept Emergency Med, Boston, MA USA		Needleman, RK (corresponding author), Cook Cty Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Chicago, IL 60612 USA.	meedleman@cookcountyhhs.org	Erickson, Timothy/ABB-7761-2021						89	19	20	2	42	ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC	NEW YORK	360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA	1080-6032	1545-1534		WILD ENVIRON MED	Wildern.

Two major consequences of climate-induced range shifts are the formation of new areas of geographic overlap (i.e. sympatry) and an increased probability of hybridisation in the de novo created contact zones. One method to effectively quantify the potential of hybridisation is to integrate ecological niche modelling and the propensity to hybridisation based on genetic divergence. In this paper, we have applied this methodology to predict hybridisation outcomes following different scenarios of climate change in 30 species of Argia damselflies. We (i) investigated how climate change may affect species' distributions; (ii) quantified if changed distributions generate new areas of sympatry between species; (iii) calculated the propensity to hybridise based on genetic divergence between species; and (iv) integrated these data to predict the future potential of species to hybridise. We found that the distribution of 29 of the 30 species was affected by a change in climate which led to a general increase in sympatric overlap among species. The degree of genetic divergence among the 108 species' combinations ranged from 0.06% to 0.36%. Based on the sympatric overlap and genetic divergence, it can be predicted that 97 of the species pairs are likely to hybridise in the future. Our results are useful to forecast how highly diverse and closely related groups, such as Argia damselflies, may respond to a change in climate and how this can impact the potential of species mixing under a scenario of increased global warming.

However, hybridization of insect species and its consequences for agroecosystems have not received sufficient attention. Gene exchange between distinct and distant genetic pools can improve the survival and reproduction of insect pests, and threaten beneficial insects in disturbed agricultural environments. Hybridization may be the underlying explanation for the recurrent pest outbreaks and control failures in putative hybrid zones, as suspected for bollworm, corn borer, whiteflies, and stink bugs. Reliable predictions of the types of changes that can be expected in pest insect genomes and fitness, and of their impacts on the fate of species and populations remain elusive. Typical steps in pest management, such as insect identification, pest monitoring, and control are likely affected by gene flow and adaptive introgression mediated by hybridization, and we do not have ways to respond to or mitigate the problem. To address the adverse effects of farming intensification and global trade, we must ensure that current integrated pest management programs incorporate up-to-date monitoring and diagnostic tools. The rapid identification of hybrids, quantification of levels of introgression, and in-depth knowledge of what genes have been transferred may help to explain and predict insect population outbreaks and control failures in the future.

We investigated whether climate change will affect the distribution and thus the pattern of hybridization between two pairs of closely related damselfly species [Ischnura damula and I. demorsa, and I. denticollis and I. gemina (this, an endangered species)]. Thus, we estimated the strength of pre and postmating reproductive barriers between both pairs of species, and we predicted future potential distribution under four different Global Circulation Models and a realistic emissions scenario of climate change by using maximum entropy modelling technique. Our results showed that reproductive isolation (RI) is complete in I. damula x I. demorsa individuals: F-1 (first generation) hybrids are produced but do not reach sexual maturation. However, RI in I. denticollis x I. gemina hybrids is high but incomplete and unidirectional: only I. gemina females produced F-1 hybrids which mate with males and females of I. denticollis and between them producing BC1 (back-crosses) and F-2 (second generation) viable hybrids. Maximum entropy models revealed a northern and westward shift and a general reduction of the potential geographic ranges. Based on the pattern of hybridization, for I. damula and I. demorsa there is a current threat as well as a rapid displacement and/or extinction of I. gemina by I. denticollis. However, the current pattern of extinction may not continue due to the contraction in ranges of the four species.	[Sanchez-Guillen, R.

These impacts may be positive or negative, and are often unquantified. In this manuscript, I review literature on the known distribution and environmental and economic impacts of 80 species of introduced bees. The potential negative impacts of non-native bees include competition with native bees for nesting sites or floral resources, pollination of invasive weeds, co-invasion with pathogens and parasites, genetic introgression, damage to buildings, affecting the pollination of native plant species, and changing the structure of native pollination networks. The potential positive impacts of non-native bees include agricultural pollination, availability for scientific research, rescue of native species, and resilience to human-mediated disturbance and climate change. Most non-native bee species are accidentally introduced and nest in stems, twigs, and cavities in wood. In terms of number of species, the best represented families are Megachilidae and Apidae, and the best represented genus is Megachile. The best studied genera are Apis and Bombus, and most of the species in these genera were deliberately introduced for agricultural pollination. Thus, we know little about the majority of non-native bees, accidentally introduced or spreading beyond their native ranges.

Whilst negative population trends within this functional group have understandably received much attention in recent decades, another facet of global changes has been overshadowed: species undergoing expansion. Here, we review the factors and traits that have allowed a fraction of the pollinating entomofauna to take advantage of global environmental change. Sufficient mobility, high resistance to acute heat stress, and inherent adaptation to warmer climates appear to be key traits that allow pollinators to persist and even expand in the face of climate change. An overall flexibility in dietary and nesting requirements is common in expanding species, although niche specialization can also drive expansion under specific contexts. The numerous consequences of wild and domesticated pollinator expansions, including competition for resources, pathogen spread, and hybridization with native wildlife, are also discussed. Overall, we show that the traits and factors involved in the success stories of expanding pollinators are mostly species specific and context dependent, rendering generalizations of 'winning traits' complicated. This work illustrates the increasing need to consider expansion and its numerous consequences as significant facets of global changes and encourages efforts to monitor the impacts of expanding insect pollinators, particularly exotic species, on natural ecosystems.

P. flavescens adults were captured by a searchlight trap on Beihuang Island (BH Island; 38 degrees 24'N, 120 degrees 55'E) from 2003 to 2016, where there is no freshwater. This inspired our research to analyze the pattern of seasonal migration and population dynamics. Stable hydrogen isotope measurement and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) were used to simulate the migration pathway of P. flavescens between different breeding habitats. The results showed that there was no significant difference among population numbers of this overseas migration across years (F-13,F- 2161 = 0.85, P = 0.604); however, the numbers were significantly different across months (F-5,F- 2161 = 3.91, P = 0.003). Our geospatial natal assignment model suggested that P. flavescens trapped on BH were originated in different geographical regions and might have three movement strategies: wandering around northern China and north-bound (positive) and south-bound (negative) movements. Among them, the majority were engaged in wandering around northern China. Model simulations suggested that P. flavescens toured around BH. The results contribute to the knowledge of P. flavescens population ecology in a large-scale geographic region and will aid in the prediction and interpretation of insect migration patterns in response to climate change.

In a similar vein, populations of insects are not necessarily homogenous in time, either over the course of seasons or even within a single season. This of course has profound consequences for surveys examining, for whatever reason/s, the temporal population patterns of insects, especially flying insects as mostly discussed here. In the present article, the topics covered include climate and climate change; changes in ecological niches due to changes in available hosts, i.e., essentially, adaptation events; hybridization influencing behaviour-host shifts; infection by pathogens and parasites/parasitoids; habituation to light, sound and pheromone lures; chromosomal/genetic changes affecting physiology and behaviour; and insecticide resistance. If such phenomenai.e., aspects and pitfallsare not considered during spatio-temporal study programmes, which is even more true in the light of the recent discovery of morphologically similar/identical cryptic species, then the conclusions drawn in terms of the efforts to combat pest insects or conserve rare and endangered species may be in error and hence end in failure.

Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed.

By means of mitochondrial and nuclear markers and of Geometric Morphometrics applied to sexual appendages, we defined i) the geographical boundaries between the two species in Italy and ii) we determined the presence, the extent, and the genetic characteristics of the hybridization. Genetic data evidenced asymmetric hybridization with the males of C.trinacriae able to mate both interspecifically and intraspecifically. The results contrast with expectations under neutral gene introgression and sexual selection. This data, along with the morphological evidence of significant differences in size and shape of sexual appendages between the males of the two species, seem indicative of the role of mechanical constraints in intraspecific matings. The origin of the two species is dated about to 1.32 Mya and the hybridization resulted related to range expansion of the two species after Last Glacial Maximum and this led to the secondary contact between the two taxa in central Italy. At last, our results indicate that the range of C.trinacriae, a threatened and protected species, has been moving northward probably driven by climate changes. As a result, the latter species is currently intruding into the range of C.boltonii. The hybrid area is quite extended and the hybrids seem well adapted to the environment. From a conservation point of view, even if C.trinacriae has a strong genetic identity, the discovery of hybridization between the two species should be considered in a future species management.

We review the emerging literature on the short- and long-term consequences of these geographic range shifts. Specifically, we focus on the evolutionary consequences of novel species interactions in newly created sympatric areas by describing the potential (i) short-term processes acting on reproductive barriers between species and (ii) long-terms consequences of range shifts on the stability of hybrid zones, introgression and ultimately speciation and extinction rates. Subsequently, we (sill) review the empirical literature on insects to evaluate which processes have been studied, and (fr) outline some areas that deserve increased attention in the future, namely the genomics of hybridisation and introgression, our ability to forecast range shifts and the impending threat from insect vectors and pests on biodiversity, human health and crop production. Our review shows that species interactions in de novo sympatric areas can be manifold, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing species diversity. A key issue that emerges is that climate-induced hybridisations in insects are much more widespread than anticipated and that rising temperatures and increased anthropogenic disturbances are accelerating the process of species mixing. The existing evidence only shows the tip of the iceberg and we are likely to see many more cases of species mixing, Mowing range shifts in the near future.

In recent years, the range of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) has expanded from lodgepole pine-dominated forests east of the Rocky Mountains into lodgepole x jack pine hybrid forest of western Alberta, and may soon invade jack pine forests of the boreal. Our understanding of factors contributing colonization of jack pine by mountain pine beetle is far from complete and several factors may limit its spread in these forests, including tree resistance and competitors. Among these, the jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus Freeman) is one of the most important insect enemies of jack pine and an outbreak defoliator that potentially weakens jack pine trees, which may make them more susceptible to MPB attacks. To develop effective management strategies in the face of the short-run impacts of climate change, we need an in-depth understanding of factors influencing establishment and survival of the beetle in jack pine forests.

Northern flying squirrels are common inhabitants of the boreal forest, also occurring in coniferous forest remnants farther south, whereas the southern flying squirrel range is centered in eastern temperate woodlands. These two flying squirrel species exhibit a hybrid zone across a latitudinal gradient in an area of recent secondary contact. Glaucomys hybrid offspring are viable and can successfully backcross with either parental species, however, the fitness implications of such events are currently unknown. Some populations of G. sabrinus are endangered, and thus, interspecific hybridization is a key conservation concern in flying squirrels. To provide a resource for future studies to evaluate hybridization and possible introgression, we sequenced and assembled a de novo long-read genome from a G. volans individual sampled in southern Ontario, Canada, while four short-read genomes (two G. sabrinus and two G. volans, all from Ontario) were resequenced on Illumina platforms. The final genome assembly consisted of approximately 2.40Gb with a scaffold N50 of 455.26Kb. Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs reconstructed 3,742 (91.2%) complete mammalian genes and genome annotation using RNA-Seq identified the locations of 19,124 protein-coding genes. The four short-read individuals were aligned to our reference genome to investigate the demographic history of the two species.

Current range shifts will likely increase the sympatry and hybridisation between recently diverged species. Here we predict future sympatric distributions and risk of hybridisation in seven Mediterranean ischnurid damselfly species (I. elegans, I. fountaineae, I. genei, I. graellsii, I. pumilio, I. saharensis and I. senegalensis). We used a maximum entropy modelling technique to predict future potential distribution under four different Global Circulation Models and a realistic emissions scenario of climate change. We carried out a comprehensive data compilation of reproductive isolation (habitat, temporal, sexual, mechanical and gametic) between the seven studied species. Combining the potential distribution and data of reproductive isolation at different instances (habitat, temporal, sexual, mechanical and gametic), we infer the risk of hybridisation in these insects. Our findings showed that all but I. graellsii will decrease in distributional extent and all species except I. senegalensis are predicted to have northern range shifts. Models of potential distribution predicted an increase of the likely overlapping ranges for 12 species combinations, out of a total of 42 combinations, 10 of which currently overlap. Moreover, the lack of complete reproductive isolation and the patterns of hybridisation detected between closely related ischnurids, could lead to local extinctions of native species if the hybrids or the introgressed colonising species become more successful.

Combining virtual and in-place field crews to model pollinator species shift in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Citizen science; Student learning; Virtual tools; Pollinators; National parks; Suitability modeling	DIVERSITY; BUTTERFLIES; SCIENTISTS; PHENOLOGY; PATTERNS; STUDENTS; FIRE	Insect pollinators (bees and butterflies) face global challenges as climate change impacts species occurrence (or extinction) within managed and protected areas. While species decline is predicted for invertebrate species, especially in sensitive ecosystems such as high alpine systems, little is known about species responses to climate change. This study seeks to understand the impact of climate change on pollinators in high elevation ecosystems, specifically within Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. These parks are connected protected areas in the United States that act as a large reservoir for conserving species, including pollinators. Students performing research amidst the COVID-19 pandemic were divided into two virtual teams (bug team and climate team) to assess historic climate data, natural history collections and plant/pollinator data from Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Each team was tasked with addressing the larger question of climate change impacts on pollinators within protected areas while also gaining interpersonal, collaborative learning skills through their experience. This paper highlights two case studies tied to pollinator decline. The first assesses citizen science and natural history collection databases to predict and field test species occurrence within the parks. The second identifies suitable habitats for species occurrence locations. Lastly, this paper emphasizes the learning outcomes students had from virtual and hybrid field settings and offers suggestions for applications towards field-based research efforts.

SIMULATING RANGE EXPANSION: MALE SPECIES RECOGNITION AND LOSS OF PREMATING ISOLATION IN DAMSELFLIES	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Calopteryx; environmental change; hybridization; male mate choice; premating isolation; reinforcement; sympatry	SEXUAL SELECTION; CALOPTERYX DAMSELFLIES; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; POPULATION DIVERGENCE; MATE CHOICE; ODONATA; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; REINFORCEMENT; CLIMATE	Prolonged periods of allopatry might result in loss of the ability to discriminate against other formerly sympatric species, and can lead to heterospecific matings and hybridization upon secondary contact. Loss of premating isolation during prolonged allopatry can operate in the opposite direction of reinforcement, but has until now been little explored. We investigated how premating isolation between two closely related damselfly species, Calopteryx splendens and C. virgo, might be affected by the expected future northward range expansion of C. splendens into the allopatric zone of C. virgo in northern Scandinavia. We simulated the expected secondary contact by presenting C. splendens females to C. virgo males in the northern allopatric populations in Finland. Premating isolation toward C. splendens in northern allopatric populations was compared to sympatric populations in southern Finland and southern Sweden. Male courtship responses of C. virgo toward conspecific females showed limited geographic variation, however, courtship attempts toward heterospecific C. splendens females increased significantly from sympatry to allopatry. Our results suggest that allopatric C. virgo males have partly lost their ability to discriminate against heterospecific females. Reduced premating isolation in allopatry might lead to increased heterospecific matings between taxa that are currently expanding and shifting their ranges in response to climate change.

Mark			The role of latitudinal, genetic and temperature variation in the induction of diapause of Papilio glaucus (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae)	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						adaptation; critical photoperiod; development; diapauses; facultative; hybridization	TIGER SWALLOWTAIL BUTTERFLIES; SEX-LINKED DIAPAUSE; PHOTOPERIODIC RESPONSE; HYBRID ZONE; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; INSECT DIAPAUSE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INTROGRESSION; POPULATION; CANADENSIS	A key adaptation in insects for dealing with variable environmental conditions is the ability to diapause. The tiger swallowtail butterflies, Papilio glaucus and P. canadensis are ideal species to explore the genetic causes and population genetic consequences of diapause because divergence in this trait is believed to be a salient factor in maintaining a hybrid zone between these species. Yet little is known about the factors that influence diapause induction in this system. Here we explored how spatial (latitudinal), environmental (temperature) and genetic (hybridization) factors affect diapause induction in this system. Specifically, a series of growth chamber experiments using wild caught individuals from across the eastern United States were performed to: (1) evaluate how critical photoperiod varies with latitude, (2) isolate the stage in which induction occurs, (3) test whether changes in temperature affected rates of diapause induction, and (4) explore how the incidence of diapause is affected in hybrid offspring. We find that induction occurs in the larval stage, is not sensitive to a relatively broad range of temperatures, appears to have a complex genetic basis (i.e., is not simply a dominant trait following a Mendelian inheritance pattern) and that the critical photoperiod increases by 0.4 h with each increasing degree in latitude. This work deepens our understanding of how spatial, environmental and genetic variation influences a key seasonal adaptation (diapause induction) in a well-developed ecological model system and will make possible future studies that explore how climatic variation affects the population dynamics and genetics of this system.

Most studies have focused on endogenous drivers of hybridization and neglected variation in exogenous factors, such as seasonal weather patterns. In this study, we take advantage of a unique dataset consisting of records of hybridization between the butterflies Colias eurytheme and C. eriphyle (Pieridae) for 66 generations (22 years) to investigate the importance of seasonal weather on the production and survival of hybrid offspring. Important seasonal weather variables for each parental species and hybrid offspring were determined using model averaging, and these weather variables, along with butterfly abundances, were analyzed using path analysis. The most important drivers of hybridization were the abundance of C. eriphyle, summer minimum temperature, and spring maximum temperature. In contrast, the abundance of C. eurytheme and weather variables prior to the current flight season were relatively unimportant for variation in hybrid abundance. Parental abundances were mostly driven by weather variables prior to the flight season possibly because these variables affect host plant quality. Our results suggest that exogenous, climatic factors can influence hybridization in natural systems, and that these factors can act both directly on hybrid abundance and indirectly through the population dynamics of parental species.

This paper attempts to model the diesel engine fueled with tamanu oil biodiesel blend. The proposed model exploits the context of neural network and the firefly algorithm is used to train it. After analyzing the various characteristics of the diesel engine, the acquired data is subjected to a proposed FF-NM method.

Anthropogenic cause of range shifts and gene flow between two grasshopper species revealed by environmental modelling, geometric morphometrics and population genetics	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY			English	Article						Climate change; global warming; habitat modification; hybridisation; last glacial maximum; niche models	NEW-ZEALAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHIASMA FREQUENCY; SOUTH-ISLAND; HOST RACES; HYBRIDIZATION; ORTHOPTERA; DIVERSITY; SEQUENCES; EVOLUTION	The range of a species is controlled by biotic and abiotic factors; both could have changed recently due to human activity. We used environmental modelling, morphometric and genetic data to interpret ecological responses at the species boundary of a pair of New Zealand grasshoppers with very different ranges; one widespread (Phaulacridium marginale) and one restricted to semi-arid central/southern South Island (Phaulacridiumotagoense). Climate- and habitat-based distribution models for grasshoppers in the past (last glacial maximum), present and future (2070), in concert with modelling of vegetation patterns imply range and demographic expansion of P.marginale and stability of P.otagoense. mtDNA sequence revealed four main lineages with pronounced differences in genetic diversity and geographical range. The widespread lineage associated with P.marginale revealed a signature of range expansion but regionally restricted lineages were geographically structured at a fine scale. Within the narrow geographical range of P.otagoense, three mtDNA lineages resulted in high diversity, more typical of large stable populations. Geometric analysis of pronotum shape identified individuals from a region of sympatry with mixed characteristics. Mismatch of phenotype, mtDNA lineage and nuclear DNA sequence indicates introgression between grasshopper species now in contact. This appears to be accompanied by P.otagoense range reduction through ecological competition. Deforestation by people starting approximate to 800years ago best explains range change and resulting hybridisation of these grasshoppers. Anthropogenic habitat modification can have indirect consequences on insect biodiversity and conservation by enabling introgression between formerly separate populations and species.

Climate change-induced sea-level rise and consequent seawater incursion into the Norfolk Broads represent a significant existential threat to the butterfly. Translocation to more secure fenland sites is recommended; several are being restored or recreated through stakeholder partnerships in East Anglia and Somerset. Well-researched introduction and management of the foodplant, Milk-parsley, is essential for such translocations to succeed. A better understanding is needed of the genetic structuring of the British Swallowtail populations using modern sequencing technologies, in particular to elucidate the significance of gene flow in relation to the viability of introductions to small or isolated sites. In a species in which hybridisation is commonplace across the Holarctic, the continued influx and future spread in Britain of the continental subspecies Papilio machaon gorganus may present a threat to the genetic integrity of subspecies britannicus, despite their differences in habitat and larval foodplants.

In accordance with the role of glacial cycles, speciation rates increased in the Holarctic Enallagma damselflies during the Quaternary, with a 4.25 x greater increase in a more northerly distributed clade as compared with a more southern clade. Finer-scale phylogenetic analyses of three radiating clades within the northern clade show similar, complex recent histories over the past 250,000 years to produce 17 Nearctic and four Palearctic extant species. All three are marked by nearly synchronous deep splits that date to approximately 250,000 years ago, resulting in speciation in two. This was soon followed by significant demographic expansions in at least two of the three clades. In two, these expansions seem to have preceded the radiations that have given rise to most of the current biodiversity. Each also produced species at the periphery of the clade's range. In spite of clear genetic support for reproductive isolation among almost all species, mtDNA signals of past asymmetric hybridization between species in different clades also suggest a role for the evolution of mate choice in generating reproductive isolation as species recolonized the landscape following deglaciation. These analyses suggest that recent climate fluctuations resulted in radiations driven by similar combinations of speciation processes acting in different lineages.

Climate change induced hybridization in flying squirrels	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate warming; distribution; Glaucomys sabrinus; Glaucomys volans; global change; range expansion	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; CONSERVATION GENETICS; GLAUCOMYS-SABRINUS; STRONGYLOIDES-ROBUSTUS; HYBRID ZONE; VOLANS; MICROSATELLITE; INTROGRESSION; MITOCHONDRIAL; DYNAMICS	There is now unequivocal evidence for global climate change; however, its potential impacts on evolutionary processes remain unclear. Many species have responded to contemporary climate change through shifts in their geographic range. This could lead to increased sympatry between recently diverged species; likely increasing the potential for hybridization. Recently, following a series of warm winters, southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) in Ontario, Canada rapidly expanded their northern range limit resulting in increased sympatry with the closely related northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). This provided the opportunity to test the prediction that contemporary climate change can act as a catalyst creating conditions for the formation of hybrid zones. Following extensive sampling and molecular analyses (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA), we identified the occurrence of hybridization between sympatric G. sabrinus and G. volans. There was evidence of backcrossing but not of extensive introgession, consistent with the hypothesis of recent rather than historic hybridization. To our knowledge, this is the first report of hybrid zone formation following a range expansion induced by contemporary climate change. This is also the first report of hybridization between North American flying squirrel species.

ECOLOGY			English	Article						butterflies; degree-days; hybrid models; larval development; lower developmental threshold; phenology; range shifts; species distribution models; thermal constraints; United Kingdom; voltinism	BRITISH BUTTERFLIES; THERMAL ECOLOGY; NICHE; TEMPERATURE; SHIFTS	Thermal constraints on development are often invoked to predict insect distributions. These constraints tend to be characterized in species distribution models (SDMs) by calculating development time based on a constant lower development temperature (LDT). Here, we assessed whether species-specific estimates of LDT based on laboratory experiments can improve the ability of SDMs to predict the distribution shifts of six U. K. butterflies in response to recent climate warming. We find that species-specific and constant (5 degrees C) LDT degree-day models perform similarly at predicting distributions during the period of 1970-1982. However, when the models for the 1970-1982 period are projected to predict distributions in 1995-1999 and 2000-2004, species-specific LDT degree-day models modestly outperform constant LDT degree-day models. Our results suggest that, while including species-specific physiology in correlative models may enhance predictions of species' distribution responses to climate change, more detailed models may be needed to adequately account for interspecific physiological differences.

Niche models focus primarily on predicted changes in abiotic factors; however, species interactions and adaptive evolution will impact the ability of species to persist in the face of changing climate. Our review focuses on the use of hybrid zones to monitor responses of species to contemporary climate change. Monitoring hybrid zones provides insight into how range boundaries shift in response to climate change by illuminating the combined effects of species interactions and physiological sensitivity. At the same time, the semipermeable nature of species boundaries allows us to document adaptive introgression of alleles associated with response to climate change.

Hybridisation and climate change: brown argus butterflies in Britain (Polyommatus subgenus Aricia)	INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY			English	Article						Adaptation; climate warming; conservation; distributions; extinction; hybridisation; Lepidoptera; Lycaenidae; voltinism	SPECIES BOUNDARY; RANGE; COLONIZATION; IMPACTS	1. Distribution changes brought about by climate change are likely to alter levels of hybridisation between related taxa, and may threaten some species. 2. Nuclear (Tpi) and mitochondrial (cytB) DNA sequence data give evidence for introgression between two related Polyommatus (subgenus Aricia) butterfly species in a 150-200 km wide overlap zone in northern England and North Wales. A history of hybridisation is evident from the mixture of genotypes present within this region: some populations contain southern-origin (Polyommatus agestis) mtDNA and northern-origin (Polyommatus artaxerxes) Tpi alleles, and many populations contain mixtures of Tpi alleles. 3. The timing of the original hybridisation is unknown, but could be immediately post-glacial or much more recent in origin. 4. Both species are now beginning to shift northwards, associated with recent climatic warming. 5. It is thus expected that anthropogenic climate change will unleash a new spate of hybridisation, potentially threatening the long-term survival of the northern species in Britain.

The roles of hybridization and habitat fragmentation in the evolution of Brazil's enigmatic longwing butterflies, Heliconius nattereri and H. hermathena	BMC BIOLOGY			English	Article						Heliconius; Hybridization; Introgression; Mutation load; Mimicry; Phylogenetics	DELETERIOUS MUTATION LOAD; POPULATION HISTORY; NYMPHALIDAE HELICONIINAE; GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE; REGULATORY EVOLUTION; SEQUENCE; MIMICRY; SPECIATION; INFERENCE; INTROGRESSION	BackgroundHeliconius butterflies are widely distributed across the Neotropics and have evolved a stunning array of wing color patterns that mediate Mullerian mimicry and mating behavior. Their rapid radiation has been strongly influenced by hybridization, which has created new species and allowed sharing of color patterning alleles between mimetic species pairs. While these processes have frequently been observed in widespread species with contiguous distributions, many Heliconius species inhabit patchy or rare habitats that may strongly influence the origin and spread of species and color patterns. Here, we assess the effects of historical population fragmentation and unique biology on the origins, genetic health, and color pattern evolution of two rare and sparsely distributed Brazilian butterflies, Heliconius hermathena and Heliconius nattereri.ResultsWe assembled genomes and re-sequenced whole genomes of eight H. nattereri and 71 H. hermathena individuals. These species harbor little genetic diversity, skewed site frequency spectra, and high deleterious mutation loads consistent with recent population bottlenecks. Heliconius hermathena consists of discrete, strongly isolated populations that likely arose from a single population that dispersed after the last glacial maximum. Despite having a unique color pattern combination that suggested a hybrid origin, we found no genome-wide evidence that H. hermathena is a hybrid species. However, H. hermathena mimicry evolved via introgression, from co-mimetic Heliconius erato, of a small genomic region upstream of the color patterning gene cortex.ConclusionsHeliconius hermathena and H. nattereri population fragmentation, potentially driven by historical climate change and recent deforestation, has significantly reduced the genetic health of these rare species. Our results contribute to a growing body of evidence that introgression of color patterning alleles between co-mimetic species appears to be a general feature of Heliconius evolution.

Such insights help inform policy on invasive species and on impacts of climate change at regional and local scales. We used the CLIMEX model to infer the response of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), to temperature and moisture from its range in the United States. We tested hypotheses on the mechanisms that limit the distribution of the ant and estimated the potential global area at risk from invasion. The ant can spread further in the United States, including north along the west coast, where patterns of infestation will differ from those in the east. We analyzed the risk of colonization in Australia and New Zealand, where the ant was recently discovered. The patterns of infestation of the ant in Oceania will differ from those in the eastern United States, with slower growth and less winter mortality. This study adds to earlier temperature-based models by incorporating a moisture response; by replacing arbitrary categories of colony size to predict overwintering success with a site-specific model based on the balance between annual growth and survival; and by comparing different hypotheses on low temperature-related mechanisms that limit the geographical distribution. It shows how the response of a species to climate can be synthesized from field observations to provide useful insights into its population dynamics. Such analyses provide a basis for making decisions on regional management of invasive species and an informative context for local studies.

Colonization and reproduction of potential competitors with mountain pine beetle in baited logs of a new host for mountain pine beetle, jack pine	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dendroctonus ponderosae; Ips grandicollis; Monochamus spp; Pinus banksiana; Semiochemicals; Pheromones	FACULTATIVE INTRAGUILD PREDATION; BARK BEETLES; RANGE EXPANSION; DENDROCTONUS-PONDEROSAE; IPS-PINI; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; LARVAE COLEOPTERA; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES	The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is a bark beetle that is native to pine forests of western North America and the Black Hills of South Dakota. Recent eastward range expansion into stands of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and associated hybrids with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in western Canada has created concern that the insect will continue moving eastward. In the Great Lakes region, mountain pine beetle would encounter novel species of pines and associated insect fauna; interactions with which are largely unexplored. We baited logs of jack pine with lures for mountain pine beetle and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) alone and in combination in a 2 x 2 factorial design in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Both insects occur in this region, but not jack pine, a common species in the Great Lakes region of North America at risk of invasion by mountain pine beetle. We measured attraction and reproduction of insects that colonized the logs. Ips grandicollis were significantly more attracted to logs of jack pine baited with their aggregation pheromone, ipsenol, than unbaited logs or those baited with pheromones of mountain pine beetle and myrcene, a host volatile. Colonization by I. grandicollis was inhibited by the presence of lures for mountain pine beetle. We also found larvae of longhorn borers, likely Monochamus spp., infesting logs. These borers, which act as competitors and facultative predators of bark beetles, were significantly attracted to logs baited with ipsenol over those baited with lures for mountain pine beetle. Our results suggest that if mountain pine beetle were to invade the Great Lakes Region, common bark and woodboring species such as I. grandicollis and longhorn borers would not compete with mountain pine beetles at tree-colonizing stages, and thus could pose little resistance to invasion.

Investigating these genetic patterns is important, as they may reveal obscured processes and players. The maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia is among the most widespread symbionts in insects. Wolbachia typically spreads within host species by conferring direct fitness benefits, and/or by manipulating its host reproduction to favour infected over uninfected females. Under sufficient selective advantage, the mitochondrial haplotype associated with the favoured maternally-inherited symbiotic strains will spread (i.e. hitchhike), resulting in low mitochondrial genetic variation across the host species range. Method The common bluetail damselfly (Ischnura elegans: van der Linden, 1820) has recently emerged as a model organism for genetics and genomic signatures of range expansion during climate change. Although there is accumulating data on the consequences of such expansion on the genetics of I. elegans, no study has screened for Wolbachia in the damselfly genus Ischnura. Here, we present the biogeographic variation in Wolbachia prevalence and penetrance across Europe and Japan (including samples from 17 populations), and from close relatives in the Mediterranean area (i.e. I. genei: Rambur, 1842; and I. saharensis: Aguesse, 1958). Results Our data reveal (a) multiple Wolbachia-strains, (b) potential transfer of the symbiont through hybridization, (c) higher infection rates at higher latitudes, and (d) reduced mitochondrial diversity in the north-west populations, indicative of hitchhiking associated with the selective sweep of the most common strain. We found low mitochondrial haplotype diversity in the Wolbachia-infected north-western European populations (Sweden, Scotland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy) of I. elegans, and, conversely, higher mitochondrial diversity in populations with low penetrance of Wolbachia (Ukraine, Greece, Montenegro and Cyprus). The timing of the selective sweep associated with infected lineages was estimated between 20,000 and 44,000 years before present, which is consistent with the end of the last glacial period about 20,000 years. Conclusions Our findings provide an example of how endosymbiont infections can shape spatial variation in their host evolutionary genetics during postglacial expansion. These results also challenge population genetic studies that do not consider the prevalence of symbionts in many insects, which we show can impact geographic patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity.

Global diversity of mayflies (Ephemeroptera, Insecta) in freshwater	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Ephemeroptera; bioregion; endemicity; diversity; distribution; introgression	AESTIVALIS EATON EPHEMEROPTERA; HIGHER CLASSIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; MADAGASCAR; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SIPHLONURIDAE; CONSERVATION; SYSTEMATICS; PHYLOGENY	The extant global Ephemeroptera fauna is represented by over 3,000 described species in 42 families and more than 400 genera. The highest generic diversity occurs in the Neotropics, with a correspondingly high species diversity, while the Palaearctic has the lowest generic diversity, but a high species diversity. Such distribution patterns may relate to how long evolutionary processes have been carrying on in isolation in a bioregion. Over an extended period, there may be extinction of species, but evolution of more genera. Dramatic extinction events such as the K-T mass extinction have affected current mayfly diversity and distribution. Climatic history plays an important role in the rate of speciation in an area, with regions which have been climatically stable over long periods having fewer species per genus, when compared to regions subjected to climatic stresses, such as glaciation. A total of 13 families are endemic to specific bioregions, with eight among them being monospecific. Most of these have restricted distributions which may be the result of them being the relict of a previously more diverse, but presently almost completely extinct family, or may be the consequence of vicariance events, resulting from evolution due to long-term isolation.

We use ants to investigate thermal adaptation and the link between temperature and genetic variation arising from hybridization. We test for differences in cold and heat tolerance between Finnish Formica polyctena and Formica aquilonia wood ants and their naturally occurring hybrids. Using workers, we find that the parental individuals differ in both cold and heat tolerances and express thermal limits that reflect their global distributions. Hybrids, however, cannot combine thermal tolerance of parental species as they have the same heat tolerance as F. polyctena but not the same cold tolerance as F. aquilonia. We then focus on a single hybrid population to investigate the relationship between temperature variation and genetic variation across 16 years using reproductive individuals. On the basis of the thermal tolerance results, we expected the frequency of putative F. polyctena alleles to increase in warm years and F. aquilonia alleles to increase in cold years. We find support for this in hybrid males but not in hybrid females. These results contribute to understanding the outcomes of hybridization, which may be sex specific or depend on the environment. Furthermore, genetic variability resulting from hybridization could help hybrid wood ants cope with changing thermal conditions.

However, geographic range shifting may depend on biotic factors such as demography, dispersal and species interactions. Recently suggested hybrid models include these factors. However, parameterization of hybrid models suffers from lack of detailed ecological data across many taxa. Further, it is methodologically unclear how to upscale ecological information from scales relevant to ecological processes to the coarser resolution of species distribution data (often 100 km(2) or even 2500 km(2)). We tackle these problems by developing a novel modelling and calibration framework, which allows hybrid model calibration from (static) presence-absence data that is available for many species. The framework improves understanding of the influence of biotic processes on range projections and reveals critical sources of uncertainty that limit projection reliability. We demonstrate its performance for the case of the butterfly Titania's Fritillary (Boloria titania).

To assess the possible risks from their habitats overlapping, we investigated the potential for hybridization and the development of F1 individuals. We observed successful mating of the two sibling species under artificial conditions. The presence of a postzygotic hybridization barrier was supported by the delay of larval development only in females; a delay did not occur in males. Existence of the barrier was also supported by a decreased egg hatching rate in one brood; this was likely associated with infection with Wolbachia, a bacterium manipulating the reproductive capability of its host. The size and wing markings of F1 hybrid individuals were intermediate between those of the two species. These results suggest that, if Z. emelina and Z. otis are distributed sympatrically in the future, there is a possibility of introgression and reproductive interference between the two species, which would increase the risk of decline of each species.

This activity impacts climate change and global warming. One of the critical problems in distribution is the green vehicle routing problem (G-VRP). This study focuses on G-VRP for a single distribution center. The objective function is to minimize the distribution costs by considering fuel costs, carbon costs, and vehicle use costs. This research aims to develop the hybrid butterfly optimization algorithm (HBOA) to minimize the distribution costs on G-VRP. It was inspired by the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), which was by combining the tabu search (TS) algorithm and local search swap and flip strategies. BOA is a new metaheuristic algorithm that has been successfully applied in various engineering fields. Experiments were carried out to test the parameters of the proposed algorithm and vary the speed of vehicles. The proposed algorithm was also compared with several procedures of prior study. The experimental results proved that the HBOA could minimize the total distribution cost compared to other algorithms. Moreover, the computation time is also included in the analysis.

However, due to climate change and large-scale ongoing movement of breeding individuals, the expansion of bees of African origin could represent another threat. This issue has not yet been recognised in detail, although bees bearing African mitochondrial DNA occur in South-West and South Europe due to natural gene flow. Here, we determine the diversity of mitochondrial DNA in honey bees from East-Central Europe. We sequenced the COI-COII region in 427 bees sampled along two 900 km transects (17.5 degrees N and 23 degrees E). We found that 1.64% of bees (95% CI: 0.66-3.35%) had African mitochondrial DNA. It is unlikely that their presence in the area resulted from natural migration but instead human-driven introductions of hybrids of African ancestry. This expansion deserves more attention, as it may contribute to the dissemination of undesirable traits, parasites and diseases. In Europe, protecting the genetic diversity of Apis mellifera is usually perceived in the context of limiting the spread of the evolutionary C-lineage within the original range of the M-lineage. However, due to climate change and large-scale ongoing movement of breeding individuals, the expansion of bees from the African A-lineage could represent another threat. This issue has not yet been investigated in detail, although A-mitotypes occur in South-West and South Europe due to natural gene flow. Here, we determine the diversity of mtDNA in honey bees from East-Central Europe. We sequenced the COI-COII region in 427 bees sampled along two 900 km transects (17.5 degrees N and 23 degrees E).

Differential effects of short term winter thermal stress on diapausing tiger swallowtail butterflies (Papilio spp.)	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; developmental threshold; incipient hybrid species; metabolic cost; Papilionidae; post-diapause delays; thermal stress	SEX-LINKED DIAPAUSE; COLD TOLERANCE; HYBRID ZONE; RANGE EXPANSION; FLESH FLIES; GLAUCUS; CANADENSIS; TEMPERATURES; LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIATION	It is generally thought that insects inhabiting lower latitudes are more severely impacted by changes in their thermal environment than are high latitude species. This is attributed to the wider range of temperatures to which high-latitude species are exposed. By contrast, low-latitude species have typically evolved in more thermally stable environments with a narrower range of temperature variation. However, deviation from this pattern can occur and here we report that under variable winter conditions a higher latitude species may be more sensitive to thermal variation than its lower latitude sister species. Using split broods, we examined the survival and adult emergence success of diapausing pupae of Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus, as well as a unique, recombinant hybrid population (late-flight) to short periods of mid-winter cold and heat stress. Our results indicate that the higher latitude, univoltine populations (P. canadensis and late-flights) exhibit lower pupal survival than the lower latitude, facultative diapauser (P. glaucus) for all mid-winter thermal stress treatments, both high and low. Size differences alone do not appear to account for the observed differences in survival or metabolic costs in these three phenotypes, as late-flight individuals are similar in size to P. glaucus. We attribute the observed differences in survival and weight loss to potential metabolic differences and variation in the intensity of diapause, in addition to divergent adaptation to winter precipitation levels (e.g. snow cover) and the influences this may have on microhabitat temperature moderation.

Both species have wide range distributions across North America, yet differences in their preferred habitat result in few areas of sympatry. Climate change however, has shifted the southern flying squirrel's range limit further north, thus allowing the two species to encounter each other more frequently. Glaucomys volans is the more competitive of the two, and also carries a nematode parasite (Strongyloides robustus) proven to be deleterious towards its sister species. The northern incursion of the southern flying squirrel may therefore dislodge its sister species from its original distribution. With G. sabrinus considered endangered in different parts of North America, and G. volans listed as "concerned" in its northernmost limit, the two species require close monitoring. Morphological identification is often challenging for incomplete and juvenile specimens, therefore we developed a molecular identification protocol using mitochondrial and nuclear markers in tandem to help distinguish each species. These protocols were tested on Glaucomys individuals located elsewhere in Canada and the USA to ensure the validity of the designed primers. Moreover, employing our methods may detect F1 hybrids. To assess the current genetic portrait of G. sabrinus populations in Quebec before the potential invasion of its sister species, a preliminary population genetics study using seven microsatellite loci was also realized. The various conservation and management implications are discussed.

Simulation-Optimization of Reservoir Water Quality under Climate Change	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water quality simulation-optimization; CE-QUAL-W2; Computation complexity; Firefly algorithm k-nearest neighbor (FA-KNN); Climate change; Reservoir water quality management	UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; MODEL CE-QUAL-W2; FLOW; OPERATION; RAINFALL; TIME	Increasing population and water use, rising pollution of water resources, and climate change affect the quantity and quality of water resources. Reservoir operation is an important tool for water supply that can be optimized by simulation-optimization considering the impact of climate change on water quality. This study presents a simulation-optimization approach linking the CE-QUAL-W2 hydrodynamic model with the firefly algorithm k-nearest neighbor (FA-KNN) model to obtain optimal reservoir discharges to achieve water quality objectives under climate change conditions. The developed algorithm overcomes the computational burden of CE-QUAL-W2. The FA-KNN hybrid algorithm is employed to optimize the total dissolved solids (TDS) while achieving computational efficiently beyond what could be achieved with CE-QUAL-W2 simulations alone. This paper's approach is evaluated with the Aidoghmoush Reservoir (East Azerbaijan, Iran). Overall, 36 simulation-optimization scenarios for dry and wet years under baseline and climate change conditions are evaluated by considering three initial water levels for the reservoir (minimum, average, and normal) and three thresholds for assessing the hybrid algorithm. The TDS released from the reservoir in wet years would be acceptable for agricultural use; in dry years, on average, the TDS would not be acceptable for 24 days per year under climate change. The reservoir in winter undergoes complete mixing; it becomes stratified in spring and summer, and it is close to complete mixing in the autumn. The highest TDS in the reservoir would occur during the summer in dry years under climate change, reaching TDS of approximately 2,645 g/m(3). (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Krehenwinkel, H; Tautz, D				Krehenwinkel, Henrik; Tautz, Diethard			Northern range expansion of European populations of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi is associated with global warmingcorrelated genetic admixture and population-specific temperature adaptations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; genetic admixture; historical DNA; range expansion	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOLOGICAL INVASION; RAPID EVOLUTION; HYBRIDIZATION; RESPONSES; ARANEAE; INTROGRESSION; INCREASES; NICHE; SIZE	Poleward range expansions are observed for an increasing number of species, which may be an effect of global warming during the past decades. However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions reflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether new genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the expansion of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe during the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary populations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography and genetic changes associated with the range shift. Based on the analysis of mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP markers, we observe a higher level of genetic diversity in the expanding populations, apparently due to admixture of formerly isolated lineages. Using reciprocal transplant experiments for testing overwintering tolerance, as well as temperature preference and tolerance tests in the laboratory, we find that the invading spiders have possibly shifted their temperature niche. This may be a key adaptation for survival in Northern latitudes. The museum samples allow a reconstruction of the invasion's genetic history. A first, small-scale range shift started around 1930, in parallel with the onset of global warming. A more massive invasion of Northern Europe associated with genetic admixture and morphological changes occurred in later decades. We suggest that the latter range expansion into far Northern latitudes may be a consequence of the admixture that provided the genetic material for adaptations to new environmental regimes. Hence, global warming could have facilitated the initial admixture of populations and this resulted in genetic lineages with new habitat preferences.

This invasion signifies a climate change-induced range expansion by a native insect. The mechanism underlying this invasion is unknown, but likely involves phytochemicals that play critical roles in MPB biology. Thus far, studies have investigated the compatibility of jack pine chemistry with beetles and their microbial symbionts. I have identified three phytochemical mechanisms that have likely facilitated the host range expansion of MPB. First, jack pine chemistry is overall similar to that of the historical hosts of MPB. In particular, jack pine chemistry is compatible with beetle pheromone production, aggregation on host trees and larval development. Furthermore, the compatibility of jack pine chemistry maintains beneficial interactions between MPB and its microbial symbionts. Second, compared with historical hosts, the novel host not only has lower concentrations of toxic and repellent defense chemicals, but also contains large concentrations of chemicals promoting host colonization by MPB. These patterns are especially pronounced when comparing novel hosts with well-defended historical hosts. Finally, before MPBs arrived in jack pine forests, they invaded a zone of hybrids of novel and historical hosts that likely improved beetle success on jack pine, as hybrids show chemical characteristics of both hosts. In conclusion, the phytochemistry of jack pine has likely facilitated the biological invasion of this novel host by MPB.

Mating in flying squirrels begins in late winter, at a time when squirrels tend to thermoregulate socially (i.e. they huddle in communal nests for warmth). We tested the hypothesis that the proximate cause of hybridization was a requirement for social thermoregulation that would lead squirrels at the range periphery to nest socially with heterospecifics. We conducted a captive preference experiment with pairs of same-sex, wild-caught flying squirrels to test the relative frequency of conspecific and heterospecific nesting. Contrary to our expectations, ambient temperature did not predict the willingness of squirrels to thermoregulate socially. Instead, G. volans nested as a conspecific pair in all trials, whereas G. sabrinus nested in conspecific pairs less often than G. volans. Heterospecific pairs occurred less often than conspecific pairs of either species. A low level of heterospecific social nesting occurred in all conditions and at all times of year, however, suggesting that the behaviour of social nesting is not a perfect reproductive barrier and might lead to some opportunities for hybridization.

We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and allele frequencies at nine microsatellite loci to examine genetic population structure across the current range of the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis), an economically important insect in North America. Two major haplotype groups occur across northern North America, from Newfoundland to Alaska, on white spruce (Picea glauca), and a third distinctive haplotype group occurs throughout the Rocky Mountains on Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The two mtDNA lineages found in northern populations are 3-4% divergent from each other and from the lineages found in the Rocky Mountains. Analyses of microsatellite data also suggest the existence of major population groupings associated with different geographical regions. In the Pacific Northwest, concordant contact zones for genetically distinct populations of spruce beetles and their principal hosts appear to reflect recent secondary contact. Although we could detect no evidence of historical mtDNA gene flow between allopatric population groups, patterns of variation in the Pacific Northwest suggest recent hybridization and introgression. Together with the pollen record for spruce, they also suggest that beetles have spread from at least three glacial refugia. A minimum estimate of divergence time between the Rocky Mountain and northern populations was 1.7 Myr (million years), presumably reflecting the combined effects of isolation during multiple glacial cycles.

Concordant hybrid zones in the mimics Heliconius erato and H. melpomene in northern Peru were carefully documented in the 1980s, and this prior work now permits a historical analysis of the movement or stasis of the zones. Previous work predicted that these zones might be moving toward the Andes due to selective asymmetry. Extensive deforestation and climate change might also be expected to affect the positions and widths of the hybrid zones. We show that the positions and shapes of these hybrid zones have instead remained remarkably stable between 1985 and 2012. The stability of this interaction strongly implicates continued selection, rather than neutral mixing following secondary contact. The stability of cline widths and strong linkage disequilibria (gametic correlation coefficients R-max = 0.35-0.56 among unlinked loci) over 25 years suggest that mimetic selection pressures on each color pattern locus have remained approximately constant (s approximate to 0.13-0.40 per locus in both species). Exceptionally high levels of precipitation at the edge of the easternmost Andes may act as a population density trough for butterflies, trapping the hybrid zones at the foot of the mountains, and preventing movement. As such, our results falsify one prediction of the Pleistocene Refugium theory: That the ranges of divergent species or subspecies should be centered on regions characterized by maxima of rainfall, with hybrid zones falling in more arid regions between them.

Spruce budworm (Choristoneura spp.) biotype reactions to forest and climate characteristics	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						biotype; Choristoneura; climate change; forest insect defoliator; genetic adaptation; hybridization; life history traits; phenological synchronization; speciation; sympatry	JACK PINE BUDWORM; WHITE SPRUCE; RETINIANA LEPIDOPTERA; GLOBAL CHANGE; TORTRICIDAE; OUTBREAKS; FUMIFERANA; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; NORTH	The spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) is the most destructive insect defoliator of forests in North America. Climatic influences on this species' life history are considered a major factor in restricting the extent and intensity of outbreaks. We examine the life history traits of the spruce budworm and related Choristoneura populations with respect to forecasting the conifer-feeding responses of these insects in changing environments. Analysis of the evolutionary relationships between Choristoneura entities, including their hybridization, genetic distances, and their degree of sympatry leads us to distinguish 15 possible Choristoneura 'biotypes'. Population trend has been associated with recruitment to the feeding stage, and two indicators of recruitment, egg weights and phenological development, are both 'biotype' and climate dependent. Among Abietoid feeding 'biotypes' and among spruce budworm populations, those from locations with extreme winters tend to have heavier eggs than those from the more benign environments. In spruce budworm, this genetically based adaptation allows populations to increase their potential recruitment substantially where winters are mild. All biotypes feed on the newly developed shoots of their host trees in spring, and are thus vulnerable to the uncertain timing of budbreak. Genetic control of spring emergence is weak so larvae from a single family typically exit from hibernacula over a prolonged period. This guarantees some synchronization with budburst. However, hybrid populations have high heritabilities. This allows rapid adaptation to new conditions (e.g. mixed host-species stands). Geographic variation in phenological development after establishing feeding sites is largely genetically controlled. The importance of variation in these traits is examined with respect to competing population dynamics theories to evaluate their utility in forecasting future trends in defoliation. We finish with a plea for jointly using alternative approaches in forecasting spatiotemporal patterns of defoliation.

J	Blok, A				Blok, Anders			Topologies of climate change: actor-network theory, relational-scalar analytics, and carbon-market overflows	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE			English	Article							SCIENCE; BOUNDARIES; POLICY; SYSTEM; SPACE	Climate change is quickly becoming a ubiquitous socionatural reality, mediating extremes of sociospatial scale from the bodily to the planetary. Although environmentalism invites us to 'think globally and act locally', the meaning of these scalar designations remains ambiguous. This paper explores the topological presuppositions of social theory in the context of global climate change, asking how carbon emissions 'translate' into various sociomaterial forms. Staging a meeting between Tim Ingold's phenomenology of globes and spheres and the social topologies of actor-network theory (ANT), the paper advances a 'relational-scalar' analytics of spatial practices, technoscience, and power. As technoscience gradually constructs a networked global climate, this 'grey box' comes to circulate within fluid social spaces, taking on new shades as it hybridizes knowledges, symbols, and practices. Global climates thus come in multiple interfering versions, and we need to pay attention to both continuities and overflows, as illustrated in the paper by controversies surrounding transnational carbon markets. The relational-scalar analytics of ANT, I contend, are well suited to navigating such shifting terrains, a task central to the intellectual as well as practical challenges raised by the climate crisis.

Elevated temperature increases reproductive investment in less preferred mates in the invasive European corn borer moth	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						climate change; Lepidoptera; mate choice; plasticity; sexual selection	OSTRINIA-NUBILALIS LEPIDOPTERA; SEXUAL SELECTION; PHEROMONE STRAINS; MATING FREQUENCY; CHOICE; PYRALIDAE; LONGEVITY; DISCRIMINATION; HYBRIDIZATION; DIVERGENCE	Rapidly changing environments may weaken sexual selection and lead to indiscriminate mating by interfering with the reception of mating signals or by increasing the costs associated with mate choice. If temperature alters sexual selection, it may impact population response and adaptation to climate change. Here, we examine how differences in temperature of the mating environment influence reproductive investment in the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis). Mate preference in this species is known to be related to pheromone usage, with assortative mating occurring between genetically distinct E and Z strains that differ in the composition of female and male pheromones. We compared egg production within and between corn borer lines derived from four different populations that vary in pheromone composition and other traits. Pairs of adults were placed in a mating environment that matched the pupal environment (ambient temperature) or at elevated temperature (5 degrees C above the pupal environment). At ambient temperature, we found that within-line pairs produced eggs sooner and produced more egg clusters than between-line pairs. However, at elevated temperature, between-line pairs produced the same number of egg clusters as within-line pairs. These results suggest that elevated temperature increased investment in matings with typically less preferred, between-line mates. This increased investment could result in changes in gene flow among corn borer populations in warming environments.

Interaction between global warming potential, durability, and structural properties of fiber-reinforced concrete with high waste materials inclusion	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						Green concrete; Hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete; Recycled concrete aggregate; High-volume fly ash; Corrosion; Life cycle assessment	LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; FLY-ASH CONCRETE; RECYCLED AGGREGATE; ELECTROCHEMICAL POLARIZATION; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; NATURAL CORROSION; BOND BEHAVIOR; CHLORIDE-ION	Concrete production requires significant consumption of raw materials and is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Because concrete is placed in varied, damage-inducing conditions, its durability performance is crucial for allowing the material to reach its intended service life and avoid premature replacement. In this multidisciplinary research program, a concrete is developed for both reduced environmental impact and enhanced durability compared to conventional solutions. These goals are realized through a novel combination of design parameters: recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) that increase reuse of construction demolition waste; a high-volume fly ash (HVFA) matrix that further incorporates industrial waste products while reducing portland cement content; and internal fiber reinforcement that increases composite crack resistance. The resulting high-performance concrete, designated as green hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete (GHyFRC), contains 39% waste materials by volume and is evaluated by life cycle assessment (LCA), exposure to a corrosive environment for 4.3 years, and structural loading. Corrosion activity of steel rebar embedded within GHyFRC was reduced through the low chloride permeability of a high-volume fly ash matrix and fiber reinforcement that limited crack propagation, maintaining the low designed matrix permeability. GHyFRC can be a more sustainable alternative to concrete under certain conditions by contributing to greater retention of flexural strength after corrosion has begun and lowering global warming potential (GWP) when normalized by flexural strength.

We classified these mechanisms in four groups: (a) changes in habitat quantity or quality, (b) predation, (c) pathogen spread and (d) genetic introgression. We review the impacts of these mechanisms on the behaviour, demography and evolution of native pollinators and their communities. In addition, we highlight some current knowledge gaps about the effect of biological invasions on pollinators and suggest some measures to minimize such effects.

As climate change progresses, the spread and intensity of biotic stress is expected to increase, with increased probability of crops being exposed to stress. Shielding crops from stress requires a better understanding of the plant's response and its genetic architecture. The dearth of research pertaining to the heterosis, combining ability and gene action studies for insect-pest (fruit fly) and disease incidences (powdery and downy mildew) in cucumber compels us to undertake this study. The experimental material comprised 15 F-1 crosses, developed by crossing 6 genotypes during the year 2015. Parents and the 15 hybrids, along with standard check (KH-1), were planted in a randomized complete block design during the year 2016 for screening against different insect-pest and diseases under natural field conditions.

Lodgepole and jack pine hybridize in western Canada, which adds the opportunity for introgression through hybridization to contribute to population structure and (or) adaptive variation. Access to large sample size, high density SNP datasets for these species would improve our ability to resolve population structure, parameterize introgression, and separate the influence of demography from adaptation. To accomplish this, 454 transcriptome reads for lodgepole and jack pine were assembled using Newbler and MIRA, the assemblies mined for SNPs, and 1536 SNPs were selected for typing on lodgepole pine, jack pine, and their hybrids (N = 536). We identified population structure using both Bayesian clustering and discriminate analysis of principle components. Introgressed SNP loci were identified and their influence on observed population structure was assessed. We found that introgressed loci resulted in increased differentiation both within lodgepole and jack pine populations. These findings are timely given the recent mountain pine beetle population expansion in the hybrid zone, and will facilitate future studies of adaptive traits in these ecologically important species.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses can provide some information that is useful to monitor the genetic integrity of Apis mellifera populations. A preliminary distribution of the main honey bee mitotypes in Italy was obtained more than 20 years ago. In this study we obtained an updated and more detailed distribution map of the main groups of honey bee mitotypes using an unconventional method that exploits the information derived from the environmental DNA contained in the honey. The results were quite different from the picture taken two decades ago. The African mtDNA lineage was spread all over Italy and not only in Sicily, where it is mainly attached to the A. m. siciliana subspecies, and where it was identified in the previous investigation. A reduction in the frequency of the M lineage was also evident, and, on the other hand, a counterbalanced increase in the C mitotypes was observed in regions all over. The obtained results provided an updated distribution map of the A, C and M groups of mitotypes in Italy, which could be a starting point to design appropriate conservation programs for native honey bee subspecies. Growing interest has been emerging on the need to monitor the genetic integrity of the European Apis mellifera subspecies that could be threatened by the human-mediated dispersion of non-native populations and lines. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages can provide useful information for this purpose. In this study, we took advantage of the environmental DNA (eDNA) contained in the honey, which can be analyzed to detect the main groups of mitotypes of the honey bees that produced it. In this study, we applied this eDNA to produce a distribution map all over the Italian peninsula and the two major islands (Sicily and Sardinia) of the following three honey bee mtDNA lineages: A, C and M. A total of 607 georeferenced honey samples, produced in all Italian regions, was analyzed to detect these lineages. The A lineage was widespread in Sicily, as expected, considering that A. m. siciliana carries the African lineage. Surprisingly, this lineage was also reported in about 14% of all other samples produced in almost all continental regions, and in Sardinia. The applied method obtained an updated distribution map of honey bee mtDNA lineages that could be useful to design policies for the conservation of Italian honey bee genetic resources.

Public acceptance of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires the availability of charging infrastructure. However, the optimal placement of chargers is indeed a complex problem with multiple design variables, objective functions, and constraints. Chargers must be placed with the EV drivers' convenience and security of the power distribution network being taken into account. The solutions to such an emerging optimization problem are mostly based on metaheuristics. This work proposes a novel metaheuristic considering the hybridization of Chicken Swarm Optimization (CSO) with Ant Lion Optimization (ALO) for effectively and efficiently coping with the charger placement problem. The amalgamation of CSO with ALO can enhance the performance of ALO, thereby preventing it from getting stuck in the local optima. Our hybrid algorithm has the strengths from both CSO and ALO, which is tested on the standard benchmark functions as well as the above charger placement problem. Simulation results demonstrate that it performs moderately better than the counterpart methods.

Evidence for spatial clines and mixed geographic modes of speciation for North American cherry-infesting Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) flies	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						allopatry; climate change; isolation by distance; microsatellites; mtDNA; range fragmentation; Rhagoletis cingulata; Rhagoletis indifferens; wing spot	CERASI DIPTERA; SKY ISLANDS; FRUIT-FLY; PLEISTOCENE SPECIATION; POPULATION-GENETICS; HYBRID ZONES; PAST CLIMATE; R PACKAGE; ICE-CORE; MITOCHONDRIAL	An important criterion for understanding speciation is the geographic context of population divergence. Three major modes of allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric speciation define the extent of spatial overlap and gene flow between diverging populations. However, mixed modes of speciation are also possible, whereby populations experience periods of allopatry, parapatry, and/or sympatry at different times as they diverge. Here, we report clinal patterns of variation for 21 nuclear-encoded microsatellites and a wing spot phenotype for cherry-infesting Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) across North America consistent with these flies having initially diverged in parapatry followed by a period of allopatric differentiation in the early Holocene. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) displays a different pattern; cherry flies at the ends of the clines in the eastern USA and Pacific Northwest share identical haplotypes, while centrally located populations in the southwestern USA and Mexico possess a different haplotype. We hypothesize that the mitochondrial difference could be due to lineage sorting but more likely reflects a selective sweep of a favorable mtDNA variant or the spread of an endosymbiont. The estimated divergence time for mtDNA suggests possible past allopatry, secondary contact, and subsequent isolation between USA and Mexican fly populations initiated before the Wisconsin glaciation. Thus, the current genetics of cherry flies may involve different mixed modes of divergence occurring in different portions of the fly's range. We discuss the need for additional DNA sequencing and quantification of prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation to verify the multiple mixed-mode hypothesis for cherry flies and draw parallels from other systems to assess the generality that speciation may commonly involve complex biogeographies of varying combinations of allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric divergence.

The sibling species Papilio glaucus and Papilio canadensis meet in a narrow hybrid zone believed to be maintained by temperature thresholds acting independently on both species. The present study tests if this assertion is true for the cold-adapted species, P. canadensis, which is presumed to be limited by the effect of high temperatures in late summer and/or autumn on pupal survival. 2. Three experiments were conducted examining the effects of: (i) short periods of high temperature stress in autumn, (ii) prolonged warm temperatures in autumn, and (iii) temperatures simulating warmer winters/longer springs upon the survival of P. canadensis and P. glaucus. 3. Results indicated that short periods of high temperatures did not induce the high C mortality rates required to be the key factor limiting the range of P canadensis. However, P canadensis did exhibit a considerably lower tolerance to high temperature extremes, prolonged warm temperatures in autumn, and conditions simulating shorter/warmer winters than P glaucus. 4. Differences in temperature tolerance throughout the pupal stage are likely to be a significant factor in maintaining the southern range limit of P. canadensis. Further warming as may occur during climate change, particularly in winter and spring, will likely affect the dynamics of southerly populations of P. canadensis.	[Mercader, R. J.; Scriber, J.

We employed a combination of modeling approaches and multivariate statistical analyses to analyze mtDNA diversity in a hybrid zone between two evolutionary lineages of honeybees in order to interpret the microevolutionary processes that led to the observed spatial pattern of diversity. The model located the west European honeybee lineage mainly across temperate areas characterized by mild winters and high water availability throughout the year, whereas the African lineage was mainly associated with warmer and drier areas. Selection could be playing an important role in shaping the life history evolution, particularly affecting the mitochondria, and also resulting in hitchhiking effects on particular regions of the mitochondrial genome.

Influence of drought on plant performance through changes in belowground tritrophic interactions	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						climate change; Diabrotica virgifera; drought; multitrophic interactions; natural enemies; plant defense	WESTERN CORN-ROOTWORM; DIABROTICA-VIRGIFERA-VIRGIFERA; CHRYSOMELIDAE LARVAL INJURY; NATURAL ENEMIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MAIZE HYBRIDS; WATER-STRESS; COLEOPTERA; SOIL; INSECT	Climate change is predicted to increase the risk of drought in many temperate agroecosystems. While the impact of drought on aboveground plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions has been studied, little is known about its effects on belowground tritrophic interactions and root defense chemistry. We investigated the effects of low soil moisture on the interaction between maize, the western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera), and soil-borne natural enemies of WCR. In a manipulative field experiment, reduced soil moisture and WCR attack reduced plant performance and increased benzoxazinoid levels. The negative effects of WCR on cob dry weight and silk emergence were strongest at low moisture levels. Inoculation with entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) was ineffective in controlling WCR, and the EPNs died rapidly in the warm and dry soil. However, ants of the species Solenopsis molesta invaded the experiment, were more abundant in WCR-infested pots and predated WCR independently of soil moisture. Ant presence increased root and shoot biomass and was associated with attenuated moisture-dependent effects of WCR on maize cob weight. Our study suggests that apart from directly reducing plant performance, drought can also increase the negative effects of root herbivores such as WCR. It furthermore identifies S.molesta as a natural enemy of WCR that can protect maize plants from the negative impact of herbivory under drought stress. Robust herbivore natural enemies may play an important role in buffering the impact of climate change on plant-herbivore interactions.	[Guyer, Anouk; Erb, Matthias; Robert, Christelle A.

In the past few decades, many studies have been conducted on the dispatch of traditional fuel-driven vehicles. As a means of transportation, NEV has the characteristics of fuel-driven vehicles, but the dispatch is different because of its unique refueling manner. With the popularization of NEV, its unique dispatch research is imminent. This paper comprehensively considers electricity and charging piles during the NEV dispatch (NEVD) process. An NEVD framework containing a novel dispatch model is proposed, which elaborates the application service of NEV. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to combine NEVD with service system. Based on the formulated model, an efficient ant colony system (EACS) approach enhanced by pre-selection strategy and local pruning strategy is designed to dispatch NEVs to passengers. Experiments are carried out to investigate the applicable scenarios of ACS-based algorithms. The results verify that the proposed EACS algorithm is an effective and efficient approach to solve the NEVD problem.

For example, these studies show that individual plant genotypes support unique composition of the plants' associated arthropod community. By contrast, fewer studies have explored how plant genetic variation may influence evolutionary dynamics in the plant's associated species. Here, we examine how aphids respond evolutionarily to genetic variation in their host plant. We conducted two experiments to examine local adaptation and rapid evolution of the free-feeding aphidChaitophorus populicolaacross genetic variants of its host plant,Populus angustifolia. To test for local adaptation, we collected tree cuttings and aphid colonies from three sites along an elevation/climate gradient and conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. In general, home aphids (aphids transplanted onto trees from the same site) produced 1.7-3.4 times as many offspring as foreign aphids (aphids transplanted onto trees from different sites). To test for rapid evolution, we used 4 clonally replicated aphid genotypes and transplanted each onto 5 clonally replicatedP. angustifoliagenotypes. Each tree genotype started with the same aphid genotype composition. After 21 days (similar to two aphid generations), aphid genotype composition changed (i.e., aphids evolved) and some tree genotypes supported unique evolutionary trajectories of aphids. These results suggest that plant evolution in response to human perturbation, such as climate change and invasive species, will also result in evolutionary responses in strongly interacting species that could cascade to affect whole communities.

This critical period is a crisis for biodiversity, but the perturbations caused by global environmental change also offer new opportunities to study the evolution of species boundaries-their persistence, formation, or collapse-over rapid evolutionary timescales. Increasing temperature means and fluctuations have the potential to alter gene flow between species through changes in species distributions, interactions, life history, and temperature-dependent behavior. This is particularly true for insects, whose geographic ranges, behaviors, and life history traits are temperature dependent. Here, we review the potential for climate change to influence gene flow and species boundaries between closely related insect species. We focus on studies that have tracked changes in climate and insect distributions and/or have evaluated temperature dependent reproductive barriers between species.

Genetic differentiation across a latitudinal gradient in two co-occurring butterfly species: revealing population differences in a context of climate change	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Summit on Evolutionary Change in Human-Altered Environments	FEB 08-10, 2007	Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA		Inst Environm, Univ Calif Los Angeles	gene flow; Lepidoptera; microsatellite; mtDNA; peripheral populations; phylogeography; population divergence; response to global change	MICROSATELLITE LOCI; COMPARATIVE PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; CLADISTIC-ANALYSIS; GEOGRAPHICAL-DISTRIBUTION; PHENOTYPIC ASSOCIATIONS; PARNASSIUS-SMINTHEUS; HYBRID ZONES; FLOW; LEPIDOPTERA; ADAPTATION	Genetic differentiation within a species' range is determined by natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow. Selection and drift enhance genetic differences if populations are sufficiently isolated, while gene flow precludes differentiation and local adaptation. Over large geographical areas, these processes can create a variety of scenarios, ranging from admixture to a high degree of population differentiation. Genetic differences among populations may signal functional differences within a species' range, potentially leading to population or ecotype-specific responses to global change. We investigated differentiation within the geographical range of two butterfly species along a broad latitudinal gradient. This gradient is the primary axis of climatic variation, and many ecologists expect populations at the poleward edge of this gradient to expand under climate change. Our study species inhabit a shared ecosystem and differ in body size and resource specialization; both also find their poleward range limit on an island. We find evidence for divergence of peripheral populations from the core in both taxa, suggesting the potential for genetic distinctiveness at the leading edge of climate change. We also find differences between the species in the extent of peripheral differentiation with the smaller and more specialized species showing greater population divergence (microsatellites and mtDNA) and reduced gene flow (mtDNA). Finally, gene flow estimates in both species differed strongly between two marker types. These findings suggest caution in assuming that populations are invariant across latitude and thus will respond as a single ecotype to climatic change.

Evolution, not transgenerational plasticity, explains the adaptive divergence of acorn ant thermal tolerance across an urban-rural temperature cline	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						adaptation; contemporary evolution; global change; maternal effect; speciation; thermal physiology; urban evolution	PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; POPULATION DIVERGENCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; ORDER	Although studies increasingly disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary responses to environmental change, few test for transgenerational plasticity in this context. Here, we evaluate whether phenotypic divergence of acorn ants in response to urbanization is driven by transgenerational plasticity rather than evolution. F2 generation worker ants (offspring of laboratory-born queens) exhibited similar divergence among urban and rural populations as field-born worker ants, suggesting that evolutionary divergence rather than transgenerational plasticity was primarily responsible for shifts toward higher heat tolerance and diminished cold tolerance in urban acorn ants. Hybrid offspring from matings between urban and rural populations also indicated that evolutionary divergence was likely the primary mechanism underlying population differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, thermal tolerance traits were not inherited either maternally or paternally in the hybrid pairings as would be expected for strong parental or grandparental effects mediated through a single sex. Urban-rural hybrid offspring provided further insight into the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation. Heat tolerance of hybrids more resembled the urban-urban pure type, whereas cold tolerance of hybrids more resembled the rural-rural pure type. As a consequence, thermal tolerance traits in this system appear to be influenced by dominance rather than being purely additive traits, and heat and cold tolerance might be determined by separate genes. Though transgenerational plasticity does not appear to explain divergence of acorn ant thermal tolerance, its role in divergence of other traits and across other urbanization gradients merits further study.

However, traits of the genital apparatus exhibit substantial and overlapping inter- and intraspecific variation. All five species have the same ecological requirements and occur in central and eastern Europe, mostly in montane areas. The focus of this work was to verify the taxonomic status and validity of Liophloeodes species using a combination of molecular and morphometric techniques. Specimens were collected from the entire distribution range and initially assigned to a species according to the aedeagal shape. Genetic diversity and phylogeny of the subgenus were studied using three molecular markers (two ribosomal, 28S-D2 and ITS2, and one mitochondrial, COI). Moreover, several morphological characters were used for multivariate morphometric analyses. Finally, presence and prevalence of bacterial endosymbionts among species were investigated. Phylogenies based on ribosomal markers suggest that traditional species are correctly delimited, whereas COI phylogeny suggests hybridization and introgression occurring between Liophloeodes species. Morphometric analyses confirmed low interspecific diversity. Two major bacterial endosymbionts, Rickettsia and Wolbachia, were detected in many populations. We argue that Liophloeodes consists of young lineages whose evolution and diversification was possibly mediated by cyclic climate change events.

Mountain Pine Beetles Colonizing Historical and Naive Host Trees Are Associated with a Bacterial Community Highly Enriched in Genes Contributing to Terpene Metabolism	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; RANGE EXPANSION; GENOME ANNOTATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BARK BEETLES; IPS-PINI; BIODEGRADATION; SYSTEM; REPRODUCTION; DEGRADATION	The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, is a subcortical herbivore native to western North America that can kill healthy conifers by overcoming host tree defenses, which consist largely of high terpene concentrations. The mechanisms by which these beetles contend with toxic compounds are not well understood. Here, we explore a component of the hypothesis that beetle-associated bacterial symbionts contribute to the ability of D. ponderosae to overcome tree defenses by assisting with terpene detoxification. Such symbionts may facilitate host tree transitions during range expansions currently being driven by climate change. For example, this insect has recently breached the historical geophysical barrier of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, providing access to naive tree hosts and unprecedented connectivity to eastern forests. We use culture-independent techniques to describe the bacterial community associated with D. ponderosae beetles and their galleries from their historical host, Pinus contorta, and their more recent host, hybrid P. contorta-Pinus banksiana. We show that these communities are enriched with genes involved in terpene degradation compared with other plant biomass-processing microbial communities. These pine beetle microbial communities are dominated by members of the genera Pseudomonas, Rahnella, Serratia, and Burkholderia, and the majority of genes involved in terpene degradation belong to these genera. Our work provides the first metagenome of bacterial communities associated with a bark beetle and is consistent with a potential microbial contribution to detoxification of tree defenses needed to survive the subcortical environment.

Elevated ozone modifies the feeding behaviour of the common leaf weevil on hybrid aspen through shifts in developmental, chemical, and structural properties of leaves	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Symposium on Insect-Plant Interactions	2007	Uppsala, SWEDEN			Populus; Phyllobius pyri; abiotic stress; leaf anatomy; salicylates; phenolics; tannins; Curculionidae; bud burst; climate change	HOST-PLANT PREFERENCES; POPULUS-TREMULA; BIRCH; PERFORMANCE; GROWTH; CO2; RESPONSES; BEETLE; CONSUMPTION; COLEOPTERA	In this study, we tested the impact of moderately elevated ozone (O-3) - 1.5 x ambient, equivalent to predicted near-future ozone concentrations - on the feeding behaviour of the common leaf weevil Phyllobius pyri L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), on two hybrid aspen [Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides (Salicaceae)] clones (clones 55 and 110) differing in ozone sensitivity using the open-air ozone exposure site in Kuopio, Finland. Three host-selection tests (test between treatments, test between clones, and test between treatments* clones) with common leaf weevil females were carried out in the laboratory in the 2nd year of ozone exposure. The beetles were offered two (four for the tests between treatments and clones) freshly cut leaf discs from first flush leaves. After 24 h, the beetles were removed and the leaf disc area consumed was measured. In the field, the unfolding of the buds was followed and samples were taken for anatomical and chemical (salicylates, condensed tannins, nitrogen, and water content) leaf analyses. Phyllobius pyri significantly preferred leaves from clone 55 to those from clone 110 in the ambient air treatment, whereas this preference was less evident under elevated ozone. Leaves from ozone-exposed trees were significantly preferred to leaves grown in ambient air. Our results suggest that the preference of clone 55 and of ozone-exposed leaves can be explained by phenotypic properties of the plant and prevailing ozone concentration through shifts in leaf development process, phenolic composition, and leaf thickness.

As these systems change, they pose significant ecological, social, and economic risk through, for example, the loss of valuable habitat, green space, and timber. Our understanding of such systems is often limited by the complexity of multiple interacting taxa. As a consequence, studies assessing the ecology, physiology, and genomics of each key organism in such systems are increasingly important for developing appropriate management strategies. Here we summarize the genetic and genomic contributions made by the TRIA project-a long-term study of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) system encompassing beetle, fungi, and pine. Contributions include genetic and genomic resources for species identification, sex determination, detection of selection, functional genetic analysis, mating system confirmation, hybrid stability tests, and integrated genetic studies of multiple taxa. These resources and subsequent findings have accelerated our understanding of the mountain pine beetle system, facilitating improved management strategies (e.g., enhancements to stand susceptibility indices and predictive models) and highlighting mechanisms for promoting resilient forests. Further, work from the TRIA project serves as a model for the increasing number and severity of invasive and native forest insect outbreaks globally (e.g., Dutch elm disease and thousand cankers disease).

To find viable solutions and reduce such alarming issues, innovative research work on recycling of unutilized materials such as fly ash and natural cellulosic polymers has been reported in this work to develop advanced sustainable hybrid micro/nano composites. In this study, the use of natural cellulosic sisal fibers with fly ash has enhanced the tensile properties and surface finish of composites. Fly ash particulates acted as fillers, additives, as well as surface-finishing medium and sisal fibers as reinforcing elements in achieving glossy finish sustainable composites. The developed composites have been found to be stronger than wood, plastics and have many opportunities for multifunctional applications. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Development of robust management and suppression plans requires accurate estimates of future burn probabilities. This study describes the development and validation of two hybrid intelligence predictive models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA), for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUC(success rate) = 0.92; AUC(prediction rate) = 0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUC(success rate) = 0.89; AUC(prediction rate) = 0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUC(success rate) = 0.82; AUC(prediction rate) = 0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolldts to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies.

The alkali-activated hybrid cement FA/OPC 90/10 was classified as a low heat reaction cement (type LH), according to American Society of Testing Materials, ASTM C1157; the compressive strength was of 31.56 MPa and of 22.68 MPa (28 days) at the levels of paste and standard mortar, respectively, with an initial setting time of 93.3 min. From this binder, a hybrid concrete was produced and classified as a structural type, with a compressive strength of 23.16 MPa and a flexural modulus of rupture of 5.32 MPa, at 28 days of curing. The global warming potential index (GWP 100), based on life cycle analysis, was 35% lower than the reference concrete based on 100% OPC. Finally, its use was validated in the manufacture of a solid block-type construction element, which reached a compressive strength of 21.9 MPa at 28 days, exceeding by 40.6% the minimum strength value established by the Colombia Technical Standard, NTC 4026 (13 MPa) to be classified as high class structural blocks.

These factors include the evolutionary history of a species as well as heterogeneity in the environment it occupies, which in turn can change across time. Most studies investigating spatio-temporal genetic patterns have focused on patterns across wide geographic areas rather than local variation, but the latter can nevertheless be important particularly in topographically complex areas. Here, we consider these issues in the Sooty Copper butterfly (Lycaena tityrus) from the European Alps, using genome-wide SNPs identified through RADseq. We found strong genetic differentiation within the Alps with four genetic clusters, indicating western, central, and eastern refuges, and a strong reduction of genetic diversity from west to east. This reduction in diversity may suggest that the southwestern refuge was the largest one in comparison to other refuges. Also, the high genetic diversity in the west may result from (a) admixture of different western refuges, (b) more recent demographic changes, or (c) introgression of lowland L. tityrus populations. At small spatial scales, populations were structured by several landscape features and especially by high mountain ridges and large river valleys. We detected 36 outlier loci likely under altitudinal selection, including several loci related to membranes and cellular processes. We suggest that efforts to preserve alpine L. tityrus should focus on the genetically diverse populations in the western Alps, and that the dolomite populations should be treated as genetically distinct management units, since they appear to be currently more threatened than others. This study demonstrates the usefulness of SNP-based approaches for understanding patterns of genetic diversity, gene flow, and selection in a region that is expected to be particularly vulnerable to climate change.

Spatial genetic structure of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak in western Canada: historical patterns and contemporary dispersal	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Review						bark beetle; dispersal; mountain pine beetle; population genetics; population structure; Scolytinae	LODGEPOLE PINE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; RANGE EXPANSION; BARK BEETLE; POSTGLACIAL COLONIZATION; HOPKINS COLEOPTERA; TOMICUS-DESTRUENS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Environmental change has a wide range of ecological consequences, including species extinction and range expansion. Many studies have shown that insect species respond rapidly to climatic change. A mountain pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred. Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i) Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to the need for population specific information to improve our understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British Columbia origin. We detected no loss of genetic variability in these populations, indicating that the evolutionary potential of mountain pine beetle to adapt has not been reduced by founder events. This study illustrates a rapid range-wide response to the removal of climatic constraints, and the potential for range expansion of a regional population.	[Samarasekera, G. D. N.

Although numerous studies have focused on forecasting China's carbon emissions, the results of different methods are contradicting, because they are based on different data and use different parameters. This paper aims to propose a hybrid carbon emissions forecasting model based on multi-factor identification to offer reliable forecasting results. First, association rule algorithm was applied to find influencing factors and analyse their joint effects on carbon emissions from the perspective of time and space. Energy consumption, economic growth, industrial structure, foreign direct investment, and urbanization are proven to be the five major factors that can cause an increase in carbon emissions. Second, a multivariate grey model optimized by firefly algorithm was utilized to conduct carbon emissions forecasting under different scenarios. Empirical results indicated that the proposed hybrid model had the best performance compared to other methods. If no effective measures are taken, it is difficult for China to realize its goal for carbon emissions reduction in 2020.

Transboundary range shifts, arising from the continuous movement of humans and livestock across borders, are of particular disease control concern. Several tick-borne diseases are known to circulate between eastern Uganda and the western counties of Kenya, with one fatal case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) reported in 2000 in western Kenya. Recent reports of CCHF in Uganda have highlighted the risk of cross-border disease translocation and the importance of establishing inter-epidemic, early warning systems to detect possible outbreaks. We therefore carried out surveillance of tick-borne zoonotic pathogens at livestock markets and slaughterhouses in three counties of western Kenya that neighbour Uganda. Ticks and other ectoparasites were collected from livestock and identified using morphological keys. The two most frequently sampled tick species were Rhipicephalus decoloratus (35%) and Amblyomma variegatum (30%); Ctenocephalides felis fleas and Haematopinus suis lice were also present. In total, 486 ticks, lice and fleas were screened for pathogen presence using established molecular workflows incorporating high-resolution melting analysis and identified through sequencing of PCR products. We detected CCHF virus in Rh. decoloratus and Rhipicephalus sp. cattle ticks, and 82 of 96 pools of Am. variegatum were positive for Rickettsia africae. Apicomplexan protozoa and bacteria of veterinary importance, such as Theileria parva, Babesia bigemina and Anaplasma marginale, were primarily detected in rhipicephaline ticks. Our findings show the presence of several pathogens of public health and veterinary importance in ticks from livestock at livestock markets and slaughterhouses in western Kenya. Confirmation of CCHF virus, a Nairovirus that causes haemorrhagic fever with a high case fatality rate in humans, highlights the risk of under-diagnosed zoonotic diseases and calls for continuous surveillance and the development of preventative measures.

In this area, maize is prone to Fusarium infections, which can produce mycotoxins that pose a serious risk to human and animal health, causing significant economic losses in the agrifood industry. To investigate the influence of corn borer damage on the presence of Fusarium species and their mycotoxins, Bt maize ears and insect-damaged ears of non-Bt maize were collected from commercial fields in three Bt maize growing areas in Spain, and differences in contamination were assessed. Additionally, larvae of both borer species were collected to evaluate their role as vectors of these molds. Non-Bt maize ears showed significantly higher presence of F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, and F. subglutinans than Bt maize ears. For the first time, Fusarium species have been isolated from larvae of the two species. The most frequently found mycotoxins in ears were fumonisins, with non-Bt ears being significantly more contaminated than those of Bt maize. High levels of fumonisins were shown to correlate with the occurrence of corn borers in the ear and the presence of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum.

To deliver this vital societal need, data-inexpensive artificial intelligence models relying on historical inputs can be a useful scientific contrivance by energy analysts, engineers and climate-policy advocates. In this paper, a novel approach is adopted to construct a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hybrid model integrated with the Firefly Optimizer algorithm (MLP-FFA) trained with a limited set of historical (monthly) data (2004-2014) for a group of neighboring stations to predict windspeed at target sites in north-west Iran. Subsequently, the MLP-FFA model is developed to minimize the error rate of the resulting hybrid model and applied at each of the eight target sites one-by-one (namely: Tabriz, Jolfa, Sarab, Marand, Sahand, Kaleybar, Maraghe and Mianeh) such that the seven neighboring (reference) sites are used for training and the remainder eighth site for testing purposes. To ascertain conclusive results, the hybrid model's ability to predict windspeed at each target site is cross-validated with the MLP model without the FFA optimizer and the statistical performance is benchmarked with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-Ns), Willmott's Index (d) and the Legates and McCabes Index (E-1), including relative errors. For all eight target sites, the testing performance of the MLP-FFA model is found to be significantly superior than the classical MLP, resulting in lower values of the RMSE (0.202-0.50 ms(-1) relative to 0.236-0.664 ms(-1)) and larger values of ENs, d and E1 (0.686-0.953 vs. 0.529-0.936, 0.874-0.976 vs. 0.783-0.966, 0.417-0.800 vs. 0.303-0.748). Despite a more accurate performance of hybrid models tested at each target site, the preciseness registered a distinct geographic signature with the least accurate result (for Kaleybar) and the most accurate result (for Jolfa). To accord with this result, we conclude that the utilization of the FFA as an add-in optimizer in a hybrid data-intelligent model leads to a significant improvement in the predictive accuracy, presumably due to the optimal weights attained in the hidden layer that allows a more robust feature extraction process. Accordingly, we establish that the hybrid MLP-FFA model can be explored further in a problem of long-term windspeed prediction with reference station input data, and feasibility studies on wind energy investments in data-scarce regions where a limited set of neighboring reference site data can be employed to forecast the target site windspeed.

Appraising short rotation coppices (SRCs), given their long-time planning horizon demands for systematic assessments of woody biomass production under a considerable spectrum of climate change prospects. This paper investigates the prospective growth sensitivity of poplar and black locust SRCs, established in Brandenburg to a variety of weather conditions and long-term climate change, from 2015 to 2054, by a combined experimental and simulation study. The analysis employed (i) a biophysical, process-based model to simulate the daily tree growth and (ii) 100 realisations of the statistical regional climate model STAR 2K. In the last growing period, the simulations showed that the assumed climate change could lead to a decrease in the woody biomass of about 5 Mg ha(-1) (18%) for poplar and a decrease of about 1.7 Mg ha(-1) (11%) for black locust trees with respect to the median observed in the reference period. The findings corroborate the potential tree growth vulnerability to prospective climatic changes, particularly to changes in water availability and underline the importance of coping management strategies in SRCs for forthcoming risk assessments and adaptation scenarios.

To study geographical patterns of diversity and contact zones, we mapped: (1) species richness; (2) mean molecular phylogenetic terminal branch length; (3) subspecies richness and the proportion of specimens that were subspecific hybrids, and (4) museum sampling effort. Heliconiine species richness is high throughout the Amazon region and peaks near the equator in the foothills and middle elevations of the eastern Andes. Mean phylogenetic terminal branch length is lowest in the eastern Andes and tends to be low in species-rich areas. By contrast, areas of high subspecies richness, where subspecies overlap in range and/or hybridize, are concentrated along the course of the Amazon River, with the eastern Andes slopes and foothills relatively depauperate in terms of local intraspecific phenotypic diversity. Spatial gradients in heliconiine species richness in the Neotropics are consistent with the hypothesis that species richness gradients are driven at least in part by variation in speciation and/or extinction rates, resulting in observed gradients in mean phylogenetic branch length, rather than via evolutionary age or niche conservatism alone. The data obtained in the present study, coupled with individual case studies of recently evolved Heliconius species, suggest that the radiation of heliconiine butterflies occurred predominantly on the eastern slopes of the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, as well as in the upper/middle Amazon basin.

J	Matosevic, D; Zivkovic, IP				Matosevic, Dinka; Zivkovic, Ivana Pajac			ALIEN PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECT AND MITE SPECIES ON WOODY PLANTS IN CROATIA	SUMARSKI LIST			Croatian	Article						invasive species; alien species inventory; taxonomy; geographic origin; establishment rate; habitat; damage	EMERALD ASH BORER; 1ST RECORD; PEST; FOREST; INVASIONS; EUROPE; THREAT; MOTH	Alien species are defined as species living outside of their natural range and outside of their natural dispersal potential. When an alien species enters a novel environment and has negative ecological and economical impact it becomes invasive species. Alien species are considered as one of the major threats to biodiversity after habitat destruction and enormous damage is done by them to ecosystems and economies. They have been described as an outstanding global problem. Economic damages associated with alien species in several countries in the world amount to about 5 % of the world GNP. Numerous alien insect species, many introduced only in the last 200 years, have become successfully established in various ecosystems in Europe, 1541 species of alien invertebrates are already present, 94 % of them are arthropods and 90 % of them are insects. More than half of the alien invertebrates are phytophagous (52 %) and 30 % of them infest trees and shrubs. Basic knowledge of the identity, origin, pathway, time of introduction of alien species is essential for assessing the threats from alien species and the first requirement when assessing the impact of alien species on ecosystems is to make an alien species inventory of a certain territory or country. Such studies are needed to assess which taxonomic or bio-ecological groups of alien insects are more successful invaders or more harmful to environment and economy. Croatia lacks such an inventory. Even though Croatia was included in most recent and comprehensive study of alien terrestrial arthropodes in Europe, Croatian references with first records were totally missing. There is no up-to-date list of phytophagous alien insect species on woody plants in Croatia. The aim of this paper is to provide up-to-date comprehensive list of known phytophagous alien insect and mite species on woody plants in Croatia with all relevant Croatian references. The starting point for compiling the list of alien species of phytophagous insects on woody plants in Croatia was a book "Alien Terrestrial Arthropodes of Europe" and database DAISIE. These are primary online resources on alien insect species available to the public and first qualified reference system on invasive alien species for the European region. We compiled the list by searching many sources of forestry, agricultural and taxonomic entomological peer-reviewed literature in Croatia, checklists and primary research publications on alien insect species. The references in these sources were examined for additional relevant publications. A total of 101 phytophagous alien species (98 insect species from 6 orders and 3 mite species form subclass Acarina) on woody plants were recorded (Table 1) and they are already present in Croatian entomofauna. They were dominated by Hemiptera (56.4 %), Lepidoptera (14.9 %), Hymenoptera (12.9 %), followed by Diptera (5.9 %) and Coleoptera (5.9 %), Acarina (3 %) and Thysanoptera (1 %)(Figure 1). One third (33.7 %) of the alien species in Croatia originate from Asia, 26.7 % from North America while 12.9 % are of tropical origin (Figure 2). From the 101 established alien insect species in Croatia, an increase in the number of introductions can be noted in the first decade of 21st century (Figure 3). Agricultural lands are the most frequently invaded habitats by alien phytophagous insects in Croatia (56.4 %), followed by parks and gardens (28.7 %) and woodlands and forests (14.9 %)(Figure 4). Order Hemiptera clearly dominates as it includes some of the most successful invaders (57 %) on woody plants in Croatia. Similar results were obtained at a country level for Hungary, Great Britain, Italy, Slovenia and Europe in general. This outcome can be attributed to the fact that species of this order remain undetected and are easily transported due to their tiny size in concert with the intensive trade in agricultural commodities. The occurrence of other orders (Lepidoptera 14 %, Hymenoptera 13 %, Diptera 6 %, Coleoptera 6 %, and Thysanoptera 1 %) is slightly different from other European countries. Results from several investigations have shown strong positive correlations between the number of alien insects per European country and the volume of manufactured and agricultural imports, road network size, the GDP and the geographic size. In contrast, alien species richness was not correlated with the total or percentage of forest cover. The number of alien insects is positively correlated with country surface area, and bordering the sea does not influence the number of alien insect species which is quite important for Croatia. There is a strong correlation between the number of alien insect species and the total amount of imports and level of international trade of the country. It can be predicted that the number of established alien insect species will grow as Croatia shows constant increase of traded commodities with other European and non-European countries. In this review we have listed alien insect species that have not yet been recorded for Croatia on European level. These are Oxycarenus lavaterae; Massilieurodes chitendeni; Adelges (Dreyfusia) nordmannianae; Pineus (Eopineus) strobi; Protopulvinaria pyriformis; Dryocosmus kuriphilus; Platygaster robinae; Aproceros leucopoda; Rhyzobius lophanthae; Rodolia cardinalis; Harmonia axyridis; Xylosandrus germanus; Caloptilia roscipennella; Caloptilia azaleella; Phyllocnistis citrella; Argyresthia thuiella; Cydalima perspectalis; Dasineura gleditchiae; Ceratitis capitata; Rhagoletis cingulata and Drosophila suzukii. Some of them are novel and only recently introduced alien species whereas some of them are present for decades in Croatia but due to the lack of a comprehensive and regularly updated inventory of alien species they have not been listed before. This also makes this up-to-date list of alien phytophagous insects in Croatia valuable. Our results have shown that Asia is the main region of origin of alien insects established in Croatia (33 %), followed by North America (27 %). The trends are similar in other European countries and Europe in general. A rapid increase in the number of new alien species introduction per year in Croatia is noticeable from the years 2007-2012 (6.4 species/year) compared to 2002-2007 (1.8 species/year) (Figure 3). In Europe, an average of 17.5 new species of insects per year was recorded between 2000 and 2007, while this value was only 8.1 from 1950 to 1974. In Europe twice as many new insect species were observed per year on trees and shrubs during the period 2000-2007 (6.3 species) compared to 1960-1979 (3.4 species). The differences between the number of new alien species/year in Europe and Croatia are probably due to differences in sampling efforts, country surface, volume of traded goods etc but the rapidly increasing trend is obvious. More than 80 % of alien insect species in Croatia (57 % on agricultural lands and 28 % in parks and gardens) have been established in man-made habitats (Figure 4). Only 15 % of alien insect species in Croatia have established themselves in natural environments (forests and woodlands) which is almost the same percentage as on European level. It is a common observation that simple, disturbed, man-made habitats are more easily invaded by insects and other invaders than complex, undisturbed, natural habitats. Alien insects linked to human environments and activities (e.g. ornamental plants, bonsais, seeds, large potted trees, cut flowers, vegetables, fruits) are more likely to be carried by human transports into a new region than insects living in natural areas. A study has shown that bonsais carry a more diverse alien insect fauna then timber and that ornamental plants constitute "miniature" ecosystems which may host a large variety of insects that have the potential to damage other woody plants as well. Almost 90 % of alien invertebrates in Europe were introduced unintentionally through human activities, mostly as contaminants of a commodity. In Europe, ornamental plant trade contributes significantly more than forestry products to the invasion of alien forest insects. As interception data have not been analysed in this paper, a research of such data for alien insect species and trade volumes in horticultural plants in Croatia is strongly needed. There is a strong suspicion that ornamental plants are one of main pathways of introduction of alien insects to Croatia due to the increase of the imported volumes from year to year. Alien insect species are known for being serious pests worldwide and they can impact habitats which they invade in several ways. Alien insects can affect native biodiversity through direct actions: phytophagous insects feeding on plants, a predator or a parasitoid attacking host, an alien species hybridizing with a native species or indirect actions: vectoring diseases, competing for food, or sharing natural enemies with native species. This research has shown that dangerous pests that can cause direct economic costs have invaded and are spreading in Croatia (Table 1). Due to high percentage of alien insect on agricultural lands (outdoor and in glasshouses) in Croatia (Figure 4) the yield losses of alien insect species on agricultural crops in Croatia must be considerable. Alien insects can have serious negative impact on forests, woodlands and urban parks. Some potentially damaging forest and urban pests have already established themselves in Croatia. In countries where the percentage of forest cover is high (Croatia around 44 %) the damage from alien insects is expected to be considerable. Most introductions of alien insects are unintentional and unpredictable. Less than 20 % of the alien invertebrates in Europe have been intercepted before their arrival. There are several harmful phytophagous alien species approaching the borders of Croatia: Agrilus planipennis which could pose serious threat to Croatian lowland oak ecosystems, Anoplophora sp. which is spreading rapidly in Northern Italy. Some of the most polyphagous alien insect species, such as Drosophila suzukii, have only recently been discovered in Croatia. This study has also shown a time lag between arrival and first record of an alien species which has direct implications on successful eradication measures. Climate change may directly influence establishment and colonisation of alien insect species in new territories-from other continents to Europe and from warmer European regions of Europe further north. Global warming is likely to influence establishment and spread of alien insect species from subtropical and tropical areas (24 % found in Croatia) especially on the Mediterranean coast. One of the main factors, globalisation, will definitely influence the upward trend of introduction and spread of new alien species in Croatia which will negatively influence economy and ecosystems.

Formosan subterranean termites (Coptotermes formosanus) and Asian subterranean termites (C. gestroi) are both ecologically successful and are the two most economically important termite pests in the world. Both species have spread throughout many areas of the world due to human activity; however, their distributions overlap in only three narrow areas because of distinct ecological requirements. In south Florida, where C. formosanus and C. gestroi are both invasive, the dispersal flight seasons of both species overlapped for the first time on record in 2013 and 2014. Pairings of heterospecific individuals were readily observed in the field and C. gestroi males preferentially engaged in mating behavior with C. formosanus females rather than females from their own species. In the laboratory, heterospecific and conspecific pairings had an equal colony establishment rate, but heterospecific incipient colonies had twice the growth rate of conspecific incipient colonies, suggesting a potential case of hybrid vigor. As all prezygotic barriers were lifted between the two species in the field, the apparent absence of post-zygotic barriers in the laboratory raises the possibility for introgressive hybridization in south Florida. While laboratory observations remain to be confirmed in the field, and the alate hybrid fertility is currently unknown, our results raise a tangible concern about the hybridization of two major destructive pest species. Such hybridization would likely be associated with a new economic impact.

The Lodgepole x Jack Pine Hybrid Zone in Alberta, Canada: A Stepping Stone for the Mountain Pine Beetle on its Journey East Across the Boreal Forest?

Global climate change impacts drought frequency and severity and is implicated in the range expansion of the mountain pine beetle into formerly unsuitable habitats. Its expanded range has recently reached the lodgepole x jack pine hybrid zone in central Alberta, Canada, which could act as a transition from its historical lodgepole pine host to a jack pine host present in the boreal forest. This field study tested the effects of water limitation on chemical defenses of mature trees against mountain pine beetle-associated microorganisms and on beetle brood success in lodgepole x jack pine hybrid trees. Tree chemical defenses as measured by monoterpene emission from tree boles and monoterpene concentration in needles were greater in trees that experienced water deficit compared to well-watered trees. Myrcene was identified as specific defensive compound, since it significantly increased upon inoculation with dead mountain pine beetles. Beetles reared in bolts from trees that experienced water deficit emerged with a higher fat content, demonstrating for the first time experimentally that drought conditions benefit mountain pine beetles. Further, our study demonstrated that volatile chemical emission from tree boles and phloem chemistry place the hybrid tree chemotype in-between lodgepole pine and jack pine, which might facilitate the host shift from lodgepole pine to jack pine.

Based on integrated hybrid life cycle assessment, this study compares the environmental and economic performance of MSWIFA low-temperature utilization with the cement kiln co-processing technique when the scenarios with or without salt recovery were considered. The result shows that the hybrid integrated life cycle assessment captures larger environmental and economic benefits of MSWIFA utilization than traditional method due to extending the system boundary to the entire economy. Especially, the avoiding in global warming, primary energy demand and human toxicity from the economic input-output system account for 15%-53%, 26%-65%, and 93%-96% of total impacts, respectively. Additionally, the hybrid model captures a considerable avoidance of cost for MSWIFA treatment. When adopting salt recovery, except for human toxicity, the environmental credit of low-temperature utilization is 3.19-12.64 times higher than that of cement kiln co-processing. Moreover, because of the saving of chemicals and energy, the environmental and economic credit of scenarios without salt recovery is significantly higher than that of scenarios with salt recovery. Findings of this study provide scientific foundations to promote the low-temperature utilization of MSWIFA, as well as multiple solutions on ash-washing wastewater treatment.

This nexus review paper will cover four significant points viz (1) the possible impacts of climate change; as the world already facing the problem of food security, in such crucial period, climatic change severely affects all four dimensions of food security (from production to consumption) and will lead to malnutrition/malnourishment faced by low-income peoples. (2) How some major crops (wheat, cotton, rice, maize, and sugarcane) are affected by stress and their consequent loss. (3) How to develop a strategic work to limit crucial factors, like their significant role in climate-smart breeding, developing resilience to stresses, and idiotypic breeding. Additionally, there is an essence of improving food security, as much of our food is wasted before consumption for instance post-harvest losses. (4) Role of biotechnology and genetic engineering in adaptive introgression of the gene or developing plant transgenic against pests. As millions of dollars are invested in innovation and research to cope with future climate change stresses on a plant, hence community base adaptation of innovation is also considered an important factor in crop improvements. Because of such crucial predictions about the future impacts of climate change on agriculture, we must adopt measures to evolve crop.

Thus, forest management practices such as changes to thinning regimes, reductions in rotation lengths, and switching to other species (native or exotic) may represent adaptive management strategies to increase the resistance and resilience of Swedish forests to climate change. Clearly, thorough analyses examining the effects of anticipated climatic changes on damage levels, and the potentially relieving effects of possible management adaptations are needed before implementing such changes. In this study, damage caused by storms, root rot and bark beetles (single and in various combinations) under selected climate and management scenarios were simulated in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands. The results indicate that reductions in thinning intensity and rotation lengths could improve both volume production and profitability in southern Sweden. In addition, cultivation of rapidly growing species, such as hybrid larch (Larix x marschlinsii Coaz.) and hybrid aspen (Populus tremula L. x P. tremuloides Michx.), could be as profitable as Norway spruce cultivation, or even more profitable. However, slow-growing species, such as Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), Downy birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) indicated low economic output in terms of Land Expectation Value.

However, it has a drawback with its application in marine/flood environments due to a lack of water resistance and frail mechanical stability. Floods have been considered one of the most periodic hazards that could hit urban areas, due to climate change. The present paper aims to address this gap and to investigate the mechanical properties (tensile, compressive, and flexural strength) and water absorption capacity of hybrid GFRP composite comprising woven E-glass fabric and epoxy resin, various reinforcing materials (kenaf and coconut fibres), and various filler materials (fly ash, nano-silica, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The composites with 30 wt.% GFRP, 50 wt.% resin, 15 wt.% fly ash, 5 wt.% CaCO3, 10 wt.% GFRP, 60 wt.% resin, and 30 wt.% fly ash showed the lowest water absorption property of 0.45%. The results revealed that the GFRP composite reinforced kenaf fibres with nano-silica, fly ash, and CaCO3 improved the water absorption resistance. At the same time, GFRP reinforced the coconut fibres with fly ash, and kenaf fibres with CaCO3 showed no favourable impact on water absorption. The identification of a hybrid GFRP composite with various reinforcing materials and fillers would assist future developments with a more compatible, enhanced, and reliable water-resistant composite, specifically for structural applications in flood-prone areas.

However, typically these effects are shown by taking parents of known genotype into the laboratory and measuring components of the F, progeny under laboratory conditions. This leaves in doubt the real significance of such effects in the field. Here we use the well-known colour pattern genotypes of the African monarch or queen (Danaus chrysippus), which also control wing length, to test these effects both in the laboratory and in a contact zone in the field. By measuring the wing lengths in animals of known colour pattern genotype we show clear evidence for all three hybrid effects at the A and BC colour patterning loci, and importantly, that these same effects persist in the same presumptive F(1)s when measured in hybrid populations in the field. This demonstrates the power of a system in which genotypes can be directly inferred in the field and highlights that all three hybrid effects can be seen in the East African contact zone of this fascinating butterfly.

An overview and experimental study on hybrid binders containing date palm ash, fly ash, OPC and activator composites	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS			English	Article						Date palm ash (DPA); Fly ash (FA); Hybrid binder; Alkaline activation; Strength; Microstructure	OIL FUEL ASH; BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS; EARLY STRENGTH PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; PORTLAND-CEMENT; MICROSTRUCTURE; CONCRETE; DURABILITY; HYDRATION	Global warming due to high greenhouse gasses emission coupled with excessive energy involved in concrete manufacturing process is indeed an alarming threat. To overcome the problem, numerous researches have been carried out to partially replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) that includes agricultural or industrial solid wastes, development of alternative binder known as geopolymer concrete made of one or more pure SCMs using alkaline activators and elevated temperature curing or by development of hybrid cement system that incorporates alkaline activation of OPC-based SCMs. This study aims to: (1) carry out an overview on: CO2 emission by construction industry; alternate cement systems such as partial replacement, geopolymers and most importantly hybrid binders; as well as identification of date palm ash (DPA) as a potential waste material and (2) develop novel hybrid alkali activated binders with a combination of agro-industrial waste to form binary and ternary mortar binders cured under water up to 28-days. The utilized SCMs include fly ash (FA), ground date palm ash (GDPA) i.e. alkali activated or raw DPA i.e. non-activated. These hybrid and non hybrid binders were compared through physical properties such as strength and workability along with microstructural properties by hydration products and pore volume. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was employed to get the mineral composition; phase decomposition of unreacted water, C-S-H/C-A-SH gel and Ca(OH)(2) had been studied by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) while nitrogen adsorption test determined surface area of particles as well as pore volume of the paste. The results revealed potential use of DPA as a strong and sustainable material in ternary blend with FA and OPC in conventional non-hybrid binder that can efficiently maximize clinker replacement without energy utilization in alkaline activation.

The influence of variation in host tree monoterpene composition on secondary attraction by an invasive bark beetle: Implications for range expansion and potential host shift by the mountain pine beetle	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dendroctonus; Climate change; Range expansion; alpha-Pinene; Pheromone production	DENDROCTONUS-PONDEROSAE HOPKINS; LODGEPOLE PINE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHEROMONE PRODUCTION; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; COLEOPTERA; FOREST; RESPONSES; DEFENSE; PLANTS	The range of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) has expanded in recent years to include many evolutionarily naive forests in western Canada. These forests include novel populations of the principal host species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the novel species jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and their hybrids (P. contorta x P. banksiana). These novel forests are chemically and physically different than native forests, and recent studies have shown beetle reproductive performance is enhanced in these novel habitats. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of differing host chemistry, specifically alpha-pinene content, on secondary attraction by foraging mountain pine beetles. Alpha-pinene is the precursor molecule for the production of trans-verbenol, the main aggregation pheromone for this beetle species. We found that elevated relative concentrations of a-pinene in bolts significantly increased their attractiveness to in situ mountain pine beetles. Seventy-five percent of attacks were found on infested bolts with the most a-pinene relative to other monoterpenes. Other measures of terpene chemistry between bolt types could not explain the pattern of attacks. This result suggests that elevated concentrations of a-pinene could increase the rate of aggregation and attack success by the mountain pine beetle in novel pine forests. Newly invaded hybrid and jack pine in the western boreal forest are reported to contain 3-4 times the relative concentration of a-pinene than lodgepole pines in forests in which the beetle has coevolved. These elevated concentrations may help the mountain pine beetle overcome some of the potential restraints for establishment and spread in the boreal forest, such as low pine volume and connectivity, and continue expanding its range.

The study took place along a steep North-South climatic gradient across the boundary between the European Continental and Mediterranean biogeographical regions spanning 460 km along the Rhone valley, France. Ants from 1690 Tetramorium colonies were collected in 19 sampling zones. Species were identified using an integrative approach based on a two-step process combining nuclear DNA (14 microsatellite markers), morphological examination and mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I sequencing. The impact of climate on species distribution patterns was tested using bioclimatic variables. Species discrimination was successful, despite a complex situation with cryptic species, inter-specific hybridisation and uneven sampling across species. Our results showed a strong effect of latitude, temperature and rainfall on the distribution of three of four species. Tetramorium semilaeve was found only south of the boundary, in warmer and dryer sites; Tetramorium caespitum extended north and 70 km south of the boundary and favoured colder sites with strong seasonal variation. Tetramorium immigrans was absent from the northernmost sampling zones and favoured warmer and wetter sites. Tetramorium moravicum was mostly found close to the boundary, but without significant climatic preferences. The fundamental role of climate as a factor limiting the ranges of these species at a major biogeographical boundary is confirmed. Monitoring range limits of these strongly climate-dependant species may offer exciting insights on the impact of climate changes on species distributions.

Matching climates in which seed sources evolved with near future climates projected for plantation sites should help reduce maladaptation and increase plantation health and productivity. For threatened tree species, assisted migration outside of the species range could help avert extinction. Here, we examine lessons, limitations, and challenges of assisted migration through the lens of three assisted migration field trials of conifers in Canada and Mexico: Pinus albicaulis Engelm., an endangered subalpine tree species in the mountains of western North America; the Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x P. engelmannii Parry ex Engelm hybrid complex, of great economic and ecological importance in western Canada, and Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham., a tree species that provides overwintering sites for the monarch butterfly. We conclude that: (a) negative impacts of climate change on productivity of Picea glauca x P. engelmannii may be mitigated by planting seed sources from locations that are 3 degrees C mean coldest month temperature warmer than the plantation; (b) it is possible to establish Pinus albicaulis outside of its current natural distribution at sites that have climates that are within the species' modelled historic climatic niche, although developing disease-resistant trees through selective breeding is a higher priority in the short term; (c) Abies religiosa performs well when moved 400 m upward in elevation and local shrubs (such as Baccharis conferta Kunth) are used as nurse plants; (d) new assisted migration field trials that contain populations from a wide range of climates tested in multiple disparate climates are needed, despite the costs; and (e) where naturalization of a migrated tree species in recipient ecosystem is viewed as undesirable, the invasive potential of the tree species should be assessed prior to large scale establishment, and stands should be monitored regularly following establishment.

J	Sun, W; Wang, YW; Zhang, CC				Sun Wei; Wang Yuwei; Zhang Chongchong			Forecasting CO2 emissions in Hebei, China, through moth-flame optimization based on the random forest and extreme learning machine	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Carbon dioxide emission prediction; Random forest; Moth-flame optimization; Extreme learning machine	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; CARBON EMISSIONS; PREDICTION; MODEL	The surge of carbon dioxide emission plays a dominant role in global warming and climate change, posing an enormous threat to the development of human being and a profound impact on the global ecosystem. Thus, it is essential to analyze the carbon dioxide emission change trend through an accurate prediction to inform reasonable energy-saving emission reduction measures and effectively control the carbon dioxide emission from the source. This paper proposed a hybrid model by combining the random forest and extreme learning machine together for the carbon dioxide emission forecasting in this paper; the random forest is applied for influential factors analysis and the extreme learning machine for the prediction. To improve the performance of the prediction model, moth-flame optimization is adopted to optimize initial weight and bias in extreme learning machine. A case study whose data is derived from Hebei Province, China, during the period 1995-2015 is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that the novel model outperforms the compared parallel models in carbon dioxide emission prediction and has the potential to improve the accuracy of CO2 emission forecasting.

Different Responses in Geographic Range Shifts and Increase of Niche Overlap in Future Climate Scenario of the Subspecies of Melipona quadrifasciata Lepeletier	SOCIOBIOLOGY			English	Article						Stingless bee; climate niche; habitat suitability; species distribution modeling; hybridization	SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE; POPULATIONS; BEES	Climate change is suggested to be one of the possible drivers of decline in pollinators. In this paper, we applied an ecological niche model to modeling distributional responses in face of climate changes for the subspecies of Melipona quadrifasciata Lepeletier. This species is divided into two subspecies based on difference in the yellow tergal stripes, which are continuous in M. q. quadrifasciata and interrupted in M. q. anthidioides. The geographic distribution of each subspecies is also distinct. M. q. quadrifasciata is found in colder regions in the Southern states of Brazil, whereas M. q. anthidioides is found in habitats with higher temperatures, suggesting that ecological features, such as adaption to distinct climatic conditions may take place. Thus, the possibility of having different responses in geographic range shifts to future climate scenario would be expected. This study aimed to investigate the effects of climate changes on the distribution of the two M. quadrifasciata subspecies in Brazil, using an ecological niche model by the MaxEnt algorithm. Our results indicate that the subspecies showed clear differences in geographic shift patterns and increased climate niche overlap in the future scenarios. M. q. anthidioides will have the potential for an increase of suitable climatic conditions in the Atlantic Forest, and towards the Pampa biome, while M. q. quadrifasciata will suffer a reduction of adequate habitats in almost all of its current geographic distribution. Given the potential adverse effects of climate changes for this subspecies, conservation actions are urgently needed to avoid that it goes extinct.	[Teixeira, K.

Yet, mixed species stands may result in similar stand volumes while providing benefits such as mitigating damage from insects and disease. To understand the effects of stand density and species mixture and their interactions on stand yield, tree size and morphology, and damage in monocultures and mixtures, we analyzed a 25-year-old experiment in interior British Columbia, Canada. The lodgepole pine (Pl)-interior hybrid spruce (Sx) experiment included three densities?1000, 1500, and 2000 stems per hectare (SPH)?and five species mixtures?1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1 Pl:Sx. Results 25 years after stand establishment showed that stand volume was significantly larger with an increasing proportion of Pl across all stand densities. Pl had 10% larger diameters in the 1000 SPH than in the 2000 SPH and when mixed with Sx (1:1). Pl had larger crowns in mixtures regardless of density. Mixture proportion did not affect gall rust incidence or stem form in Pl, but reduced attack in Sx by spruce weevil. Our findings suggest that mixing Pl-Sx and high planting density decrease weevil attacks in Sx, which reduce loss in timber quality. Yet, Pl quality may decrease when mixed with Sx, due to larger Pl crowns. These results may be used to improve the implementation of management strategies that decrease trade-offs between yields, desired market tree sizes, and timber loss from pest and pathogens, while making the stands more resilient to further climate change impact.

Genetic architecture and phenotypic plasticity of thermally-regulated traits in an eruptive species, Dendroctonus ponderosae	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY			English	Article						Adult size; Bark beetle; Climate change; Development time; Mountain pine beetle; Reaction norm	MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE; DEVELOPMENT TIME; BODY-SIZE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIFE-HISTORY; WING SIZE; SCOLYTIDAE; COLEOPTERA; TEMPERATURE; EVOLUTION	Phenotypic plasticity in thermally-regulated traits enables close tracking of changing environmental conditions, and can thereby enhance the potential for rapid population increase, a hallmark of outbreak insect species. In a changing climate, exposure to conditions that exceed the capacity of existing phenotypic plasticity may occur. Combining information on genetic architecture and trait plasticity among populations that are distributed along a latitudinal cline can provide insight into how thermally-regulated traits evolve in divergent environments and the potential for adaptation. Dendroctonus ponderosae feed on Pinus species in diverse climatic regimes throughout western North America, and show eruptive population dynamics. We describe geographical patterns of plasticity in D. ponderosae development time and adult size by examining reaction norms of populations from multiple latitudes. The relative influence of additive and non-additive genetic effects on population differences in the two phenotypic traits at a single temperature is quantified using line-cross experiments and joint-scaling tests. We found significant genetic and phenotypic variation among D. ponderosae populations. Simple additive genetic variance was not the primary source of the observed variation, and dominance and epistasis contributed greatly to the genetic divergence of the two thermally-regulated traits. Hybrid breakdown was also observed in F-2 hybrid crosses between northern and southern populations, further indication of substantial genetic differences among clinal populations and potential reproductive isolation within D. ponderosae. Although it is unclear what maintains variation in the life-history traits, observed plasticity in thermally-regulated traits that are directly linked to rapid numerical change may contribute to the outbreak nature of D. ponderosae, particularly in a changing climate.

Thus, we compared the extent of pine weevil feeding on two dominant native conifers, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), the non-host deciduous broadleaf hybrid aspen (Populus x wettsteinii Hamet-Ahti) and four introduced conifers: Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), hybrid larch (Larix x marschlinsii Coaz), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon). The extent of feeding damage on seedlings and its effect on their vitality were examined in a field study in south-central Sweden and a laboratory experiment, which gave largely consistent results. Generally, the species most heavily attacked by the pine weevil, in both experiments, were Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. In the field experiment pine weevils killed or severely damaged significantly higher proportions of Douglas fir and Sitka spruce seedlings (60%) than any other species except Norway spruce (49%). Among conifer seedlings the proportions of killed or severely damaged seedlings were lowest for Scots pine and hybrid larch (27%) and Lodgepole pine (36%). The results indicate that most conifer species planted on young clear-cuttings in Sweden need some kind of pine weevil protection, and the possibility that introducing new tree species might increase damage caused by pests must be considered. For instance, widespread use of hybrid aspen could reduce damage by pine weevils, but increase damage by other, untested pests or pathogens.

Climate-driven range shift prompts species replacement	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Aphaenogaster; Rudis complex; Hybridization; Traits; Phenotypic plasticity; Phylogenetics	POLEWARD SHIFTS; POPULATIONS; PHYLOGENY; DIVERSITY; COMPLEX; FIRE; ANTS; DIFFERENTIATION; SALAMANDERS; TEMPERATURE	Climate change prompts warm-tolerant species upward and poleward to either displace or replace cold-tolerant species. Warm-tolerant species may replace cold-tolerant individuals with upward migration, or cold-tolerant genes if the species hybridize. We examined genetic and morphological differences between low elevation, warm-tolerant (Aphaenogaster rudis) and high elevation cold-tolerant (A. picea) ant species that form an upward-shifting ecotone in the southern Appalachian Mountains (USA). The A. picea/A. rudis ecotone shifted upward ca. 200 m between the decades 1970 and 2010, and characteristic morphological traits appeared muddled where the species met, suggesting hybridization. However, we found no evidence of genetic hybridization, and the trait most associated with species identity, pigmentation, remained so across the environmental gradients. Conversely, femur length did not differentiate well between species identities, and it shifted across the environmental gradients. These results suggest that the cold tolerant A. picea, associated with high-elevation and high-latitude, was replaced by the warm-tolerant, low elevation A. rudis species. As such, these results suggest that less competitive cold-tolerant species may be replaced by more competitive cold-intolerant species with climate warming.	[Warren, R.

Can local adaptation explain varying patterns of herbivory tolerance in a recently introduced woody plant in North America?	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						carbon allocation; climate change; Diorhabda carinulata; local adaptation; non-structural carbohydrates; Tamarix	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENT; WESTERN UNITED-STATES; CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; SALTCEDAR TAMARIX SPP.; MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE; GENETIC-VARIATION; DIORHABDA-CARINULATA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COLEOPTERA-CHRYSOMELIDAE; CARBOHYDRATE RESERVES	Patterns of woody-plant mortality have been linked to global-scale environmental changes, such as extreme drought, heat stress, more frequent and intense fires, and episodic outbreaks of insects and pathogens. Although many studies have focussed on survival and mortality in response to specific physiological stresses, little attention has been paid to the role of genetic heritability of traits and local adaptation in influencing patterns of plant mortality, especially in non-native species. Tamarix spp. is a dominant, non-native riparian tree in western North America that is experiencing dieback in some areas of its range due to episodic herbivory by the recently introduced northern tamarisk leaf beetle (Diorhabda carinulata). We propose that genotype x environment interactions largely underpin current and future patterns of Tamarix mortality. We anticipate that (i) despite its recent introduction, and the potential for significant gene flow, Tamarix in western North America is generally adapted to local environmental conditions across its current range in part due to hybridization of two species; (ii) local adaptation to specific climate, soil and resource availability will yield predictable responses to episodic herbivory; and (iii) the ability to cope with a combination of episodic herbivory and increased aridity associated with climate change will be largely based on functional tradeoffs in resource allocation. This review focusses on the potential heritability of plant carbon allocation patterns in Tamarix, focussing on the relative contribution of acquired carbon to non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools versus other sinks as the basis for surviving episodic disturbance. Where high aridity and/or poor edaphic position lead to chronic stress, NSC pools may fall below a minimum threshold because of an imbalance between the supply of carbon and its demand by various sinks. Identifying patterns of local adaptation of traits related to resource allocation will improve forecasting of Tamarix population susceptibility to episodic herbivory.

Plant species' distributions will largely depend on their ability to respond to the combined effect of drought and other environmental stressors. Genetic diversity in morpho-functional traits are key components of this response. Yet, information on the response to multiple stresses is scarce for many iconic species. The present study assessed the variability in the response of populations and half-sib families of a Mediterranean acidophilous tree, cork oak, to drought and changes in soil conditions.Materials and Methods:We sampled acorns of half-sib families from two cork oak populations genetically introgressed with the alkaline-tolerant speciesQuercus ilexL., and from a non-introgressed cork oak population located in its core habitat. We germinated the acorns and subjected seedlings to contrasted levels of water availability and additions of calcium and magnesium carbonate, and assessed their morpho-physiological response.Results:Response to drought and soil chemistry composition differed between populations and families. For some traits, introgressed populations responded similarly to drought than the non-introgressed population. Conversely, the response to soil chemistry was not clearly related to introgression. When considering half-sib families within populations, the population effect diminished, which revealed the importance of intra-population variation. However, relevant traits for water scarcity adaptations, such as specific leaf area and root:shoot ratio, remained significantly different at the population level, which highlights the relevance of these traits for management.Conclusions:Our study shows that the adaptive management and restoration of cork oak forests should consider not only geographic provenances, but also half-sib lines within populations.

In a watershed, a particularly important research question concerning the relationship between land use and climate change and the flood risk is the subject of controversy in the literature. This study aims to assess the effects of land use and climate change on the flood susceptibility in the watershed Nhat Le-Kien Giang, Vietnam using machine learning and Land Change Modeler. The results show that Social Ski Driver Optimization (SSD), Fruit Fly Optimization (FFO), Sailfish Optimization (SFO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) successfully improve the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model's performance, with a value of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.96. Among them, the SVM-FFO model was better with the value of AUC of 0.984, followed by SVM-SFO (AUC = 0.983), SVM-SSD (AUC = 0.98), SVM-PSO (AUC = 0.97), respectively. In addition, the areas with high and very high flood susceptibility in the study area increased by about 30 km(2) from 2020 to 2050 with the SVM-FFO model. Our results underline the consequences of unplanned development. Thus, by applying the theoretical framework of this study, decision makers can take sound more planning measures, such as avoiding construction in areas often affected by floods, etc. Although in this study flood susceptibility is studied in a Central Coast province, the results can be applied to other rapidly developing and flood-prone provinces of Vietnam.

Bluefin tunas are commercially important fishes worldwide, and some populations are threatened. They are renowned for their endothermy, maintaining elevated temperatures of the oxidative locomotor muscle, viscera, brain and eyes, and occupying cold, productive high-latitude waters. Less cold-tolerant tunas, such as yellowfin tuna, by contrast, remain in warm-temperate to tropical waters year-round, reproducing more rapidly than most temperate bluefin tuna populations, providing resiliency in the face of large-scale industrial fisheries. Despite the importance of these traits to not only fisheries but also habitat utilization and responses to climate change, little is known of the genetic processes underlying the diversification of tunas. In collecting and analyzing sequence data across 29,556 genes, we found that parallel selection on standing genetic variation is associated with the evolution of endothermy in bluefin tunas. This includes two shared substitutions in genes encoding glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that contributes to thermogenesis in bumblebees and mammals, as well as four genes involved in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, b-oxidation, and superoxide removal. Using phylogenetic techniques, we further illustrate that the eight Thunnus species are genetically distinct, but found evidence of mitochondrial genome introgression across two species. Phylogeny-based metrics highlight conservation needs for some of these species.

The leading edge has reached Alberta where forest composition shifts from lodgepole to jack pine through a hybrid zone. The susceptibility of jack pine to MPB is a major concern, but there has been no evidence of host-range expansion, in part due to the difficulty in distinguishing the parentals and their hybrids. We tested the utility of a panel of microsatellite loci optimized for both species to classify lodgepole pine, jack pine and their hybrids using simulated data. We were able to accurately classify simulated individuals, and hence applied these markers to identify the ancestry of attacked trees. Here we show for the first time successful MPB attack in natural jack pine stands at the leading edge of the epidemic. This once unsuitable habitat is now a novel environment for MPB to exploit, a potential risk which could be exacerbated by further climate change. The consequences of host-range expansion for the vast boreal ecosystem could be significant.	[Cullingham, Catherine I.; Cooke, Janice E.

Scol. Col.) damages into the large-scale forest scenario model EFISCEN. A two-stage multivariate statistical meta-model was used to upscale stand level damages by bark beetles as simulated in the hybrid forest patch model PICUS v1.41. Comparing EFISCEN simulations including the new bark beetle disturbance module against a 15-year damage time series for Austria showed good agreement at province level (RA(2) between 0.496 and 0.802). A scenario analysis of climate change impacts on bark beetle-induced damages in Austria's Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.)

Studying two adaptive management strategies (species change) revealed a considerable time-lag between the start of adaptation measures and a decrease in simulated damages by bark beetles.

However, genetic modifications sometimes result in unintended effects on innate traits involved in plant-herbivore interactions. The importance of intentional changes in plant defence relative to unintentional changes and the natural variation among clones used in forestry has not been evaluated. By a combination of biochemical measurements and bioassays we investigated if insect feeding on GM aspens is more affected by intentional (induction Bt toxins) than of unintentional, non-target changes or clonal differences in innate plant defence. We used two hybrid wildtype clones (Populus tremula x P. tremuloides and Populus tremula x P. alba) of aspen that have been genetically modified for 1) insect resistance (two Bt lines) or 2) reduced lignin properties (two lines COMT and CAD), respectively. Our measurements of biochemical properties suggest that unintended changes by GM modifications (occurring due to events in the transformation process) in innate plant defence (phenolic compounds) were generally smaller but fundamentally different than differences seen among different wildtype clones (e. g. quantitative and qualitative, respectively). However, neither clonal differences between the two wildtype clones nor unintended changes in phytochemistry influenced consumption by the leaf beetle (Phratora vitellinae). By contrast, Bt induction had a strong direct intended effect as well as a post experiment effect on leaf beetle consumption. The latter suggested lasting reduction of beetle fitness following Bt exposure that is likely due to intestinal damage suffered by the initial Bt exposure. We conclude that Bt induction clearly have intended effects on a target species. Furthermore, the effect of unintended changes in innate plant defence traits, when they occur, are context dependent and have in comparison to Bt induction probably less pronounced effect on targeted herbivores.

Furthermore, climate change-induced range shifts have been reported in many taxa, and understanding the implications of these shifts remains a priority and a challenge. Here, we use Maxent to predict current suitable habitat and to project future distributions of two closely related, parapatrically distributedPhymataspecies in light of anthropogenic climate change. Location North America. Taxon Phymata americanaMelin 1930 andPhymata pennsylvanicaHandlirsch 1897, Family:Reduviidae, Order: Hemiptera. Methods We used the maximum entropy modeling software Maxent to identify environmental variables maintaining the distribution of twoPhymataspecies,Phymata americanaandPhymata pennsylvanica. Species occurrence data were collected from museum databases, and environmental data were collected from WorldClim. Once we gathered distribution maps for both species, we created binary suitability maps of current distributions. To predict future distributions in 2050 and 2070, the same environmental variables were used, this time under four different representative concentration pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5; as well, binary suitability maps of future distributions were also created. To visualize potential future hybridization, the degree of overlap between the twoPhymataspecies was calculated. Results The strongest predictor toP. americanaranges was the mean temperature of the warmest quarter, while precipitation of the driest month and mean temperature of the warmest quarter were strong predictors ofP. pennsylvanicaranges. Future ranges forP. americanaare predicted to increase northwestward at higher CO(2)concentrations. Suitable ranges forP. pennsylvanicaare predicted to decrease with slight fluctuations around range edges. There is an increase in overlapping ranges of the two species in all future predictions. Main conclusions These evidences for different environmental requirements forP. americanaandP. pennsylvanicaaccount for their distinct ranges. Because these species are ecologically similar and can hybridize, climate change has potentially important eco-evolutionary ramifications. Overall, our results are consistent with effects of climate change that are highly variable across species, geographic regions, and over time.

Recent human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases will exacerbate global warming and thus induce threats to cold-adapted taxa. However, the impacts of this major climate change on transcontinental temperate species are still poorly understood. Here, we generated extensive genomic datasets for a water strider, Aquarius paludum, which was sampled across its entire distribution in Eurasia and used these datasets in combination with ecological niche modeling (ENM) to elucidate the influence of the Holocene and future climate warming on its population structure and demographic history. We found that A. paludum consisted of two phylogeographic lineages that diverged in the middle Pleistocene, which resulted in a "west-east component" genetic pattern that was probably triggered by Central Asia-Mongoxin aridification and Pleistocene glaciations. The diverged western and eastern lineages had a second contact in the Holocene, which shaped a temporary hybrid zone located at the boundary of the arid-semiarid regions of China. Future predictions detected a potentially novel northern corridor to connect the western and eastern populations, indicating west-east gene flow would possibly continue to intensify under future warming climate conditions. Further integrating phylogeographic and ENM analyses of multiple Eurasian temperate taxa based on published studies reinforced our findings on the "west-east component" genetic pattern and the predicted future northern corridor for A. paludum. Our study provided a detailed paradigm from a phylogeographic perspective of how transcontinental temperate species differ from cold-adapted taxa in their response to climate warming.

Species-specific pollination by fungus gnats has been discovered in several plant taxa, suggesting that they can contribute to reproductive isolation. Nevertheless, their contribution has not been studied in detail, partly because they are too small for field observations during flower visitation. To quantify their flower visitation, we used the genus Arisaema (Araceae) because the pitcher-like spathe of Arisaema can trap all floral visitors. Methods We evaluated floral visitor assemblage in an altitudinal gradient including five Arisaema species. We also examined interspecific differences in altitudinal distribution (geographic isolation) and flowering phenology (phenological isolation). To exclude the effect of interspecific differences in altitudinal distribution on floral visitor assemblage, we established ten experimental plots including the five Arisaema species in high- and low-altitude areas and collected floral visitors. We also collected floral visitors in three additional sites. Finally, we estimated the strength and contribution of these three reproductive barriers using a unified formula for reproductive isolation. Key Results Each Arisaema species selectively attracted different fungus gnats in the altitudinal gradient, experimental plots and additional sites. Altitudinal distribution and flowering phenology differed among the five Arisaema species, whereas the strength of geographic and phenological isolations were distinctly weaker than those in pollinator isolation. Nevertheless, the absolute contribution of pollinator isolation to total reproductive isolation was weaker than geographic and phenological isolations, because pollinator isolation functions after the two early-acting barriers in plant life history. Conclusions Our results suggest that selective pollination by fungus gnats potentially contributes to reproductive isolation. Since geographic and phenological isolations can be disrupted by habitat disturbance and interannual climate change, the strong and stable pollinator isolation might compensate for the weakened early-acting barriers as an alternative reproductive isolation among the five Arisaema species.

Between 1998 and 2016, pine forests throughout the western United States experienced the largest and most destructive outbreak of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) on record, with most of the affected forests located on lands owned and managed by the U.S. government as national forests. Socio-political responses to this event in many geographies included the emergence of local to regional hybrid networks that provided direction and resources for responding to the disturbance event. In this study, we analyze the ability of governance networks to adapt in the face of the insect outbreak across four regional geographies: The Black Hills region of South Dakota and Wyoming; northern Colorado; northeastern Washington; and southwestern Montana. Specifically, we ask what factors accounted for divergent governance responses in the four cases and to what extent the emergent governance dynamics in each case facilitated lasting, long-term adaptation. Our results highlight governance trajectories as products of their respective histories and of feedback cycles among socio-political, institutional, and technological variables. By analyzing the origin, characteristics, and persistence of institutional change, this research contributes a comparative perspective on the adaptive potential of networks as functions of influences from multiple spatial and temporal scales.

Breeding for submergence tolerant rice varieties has been conducted to mitigate the adverse effects and help farmers to reduce yield loss. The present study was carried out to introgress the submergence tolerance QTL (Sub1) from IR64-Sub1 into drought-tolerant lines; UKM5 and UKM91 possessing the drought yield quantitative trait loci (qDTYs), viz. qDTY(12.1) and qDTY(3.1), and to evaluate the effects of the combination of these QTLs in improving the morpho-physiological traits and survival under submergence. UKM5 and UKM91 were selected as the recipient of the Sub1 locus because of the intermediate submergence tolerance they possessed even though they only have qDTY/s. Therefore, the introgression of Sub1 into these lines was hypothesised to enhance survival. Submergence stress was given for 14 days to BC1F4 lines from the two breeding populations. Lines with better survival than the tolerant check, IR64-Sub1 were selected and evaluated under 18 days of submergence stress. Generally, lines with Sub1 and qDTYs from UKM5*/IR64-Sub1 and UKM91*/IR64-Sub1 populations had higher survival rate (SR) of 90-100%, lower shoot elongation percentage (EP) and a smaller percentage of chlorophyll content change (CCC) than IR64-Sub1. The selected lines also showed a low percentage of non-structural carbohydrate change (NSCC) which related to the ability to recover after submergence. In both populations, the interaction of qDTY(3.1) with Sub1 proved to give the best improvement on EP and CCC. This experiment provides novel findings; that is, the combinations of Sub1 + qDTY(12.1) + qDTY(3.1) showed high survival rate in the population of UKM5*/IR64-Sub1, while qDTY(3.1) improved SR of the lines from UKM91*/IR64-Sub1 population to 100%. These results proved that the action of Sub1, qDTY/s and their interaction differ in contrasting population or background. The QTL combinations showed a consistent effect in both submergence experiments and proved the effectiveness of Sub1 and qDTYs combinations in enhancing the morpho-physiological traits and survival.

The aim of this study is to assess the gene flow patterns in Burkina Faso goat and to ascertain the most likely factors influencing geographic patterns of genetic variation in the Burkina Faso goat population. Results: A total of 520 goat were sampled in 23 different locations of Burkina Faso and genotyped for a set of 19 microsatellites. Data deposited in the Dryad repository: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.41h46j37. Although overall differentiation is poor (F-ST = 0.067 +/- 0.003), the goat population of Burkina Faso is far from being homogeneous. Barrier analysis pointed out the existence of: a) genetic discontinuities in the Central and Southeast Burkina Faso; and b) genetic differences within the goat sampled in the Sahel or the Sudan areas of Burkina Faso. Principal component analysis and admixture proportion scores were computed for each population sampled and used to construct interpolation maps. Furthermore, Population Graph analysis revealed that the Sahel and the Sudan environmental areas of Burkina Faso were connected through a significant number of extended edges, which would be consistent with the hypothesis of long-distance dispersal. Genetic variation of Burkina Faso goat followed a geographic-related pattern. This pattern of variation is likely to be related to the presence of vectors of African animal trypanosomosis. Partial Mantel test identified the present Northern limit of trypanosome vectors as the most significant landscape boundary influencing the genetic variability of Burkina Faso goat (p = 0.008). The contribution of Sahel goat genes to the goat populations in the Northern and Eastern parts of the Sudan-Sahel area of Burkina Faso was substantial. The presence of perennial streams explains the existence of trypanosome vectors. The South half of the Nakambe river (Southern Ouagadougou) and the Mouhoun river loop determined, respectively, the Eastern and Northern limits for the expansion of Sahelian goat genes. Furthermore, results from partial Mantel test suggest that the introgression of Sahelian goat genes into Djallonke goat using human-influenced genetic corridors has a limited influence when compared to the biological boundary defined by the northern limits for the distribution of the tsetse fly. However, the genetic differences found between the goat sampled in Bobo Dioulasso and the other populations located in the Sudan area of Burkina Faso may be explained by the broad goat trade favoured by the main road of the country. Conclusions: The current analysis clearly suggests that genetic variation in Burkina Faso goat: a) follows a North to South clinal; and b) is affected by the distribution of the tsetse fly that imposes a limit to the Sahelian goat expansion due to their trypanosusceptibility. Here we show how extensive surveys on livestock populations can be useful to indirectly assess the consequences of climate change and human action in developing countries.

The geographic areas that are currently most food-insecure are likely to be most affected by changing climates. Climate change is likely to affect all dimensions of crop production. Agricultural crop production depends upon the timely availability of good-quality seeds in adequate quantity at affordable prices to the farming communities. Genetic diversity and breeding for improved stress-tolerant genotypes are key elements in tackling climate change. Plant genetic resources (PGRs) are important sources for developing new and improved varieties. The loss of these genetic resources due to climate change will deprive source of diversity and tolerance. Currently, more emphasis has been placed for ex situ conservation, while equally if not more urgency is required to conserve the PGRs in in situ. At present, a number of international agreements are enforced for germplasm exchange and utilization. Some of the important methods to develop and disseminate new cultivars include breeding new crop varieties for wider adaptation under adverse climatic conditions using both classical and modern approaches and seed production through participatory approaches. Participatory breeding programs have successfully led to the development and dissemination of varieties in cereals. Seed industry plays an important role in increasing productivity of crops. The adverse effect of climate change on the seed industry can be minimized by developing efficient seed management systems: breeding, seed production, seed certification, and seed trade. Some efficient systems include adjustment of crop calendars for quality seed production, management of pollinators, strengthening hybrid seed production, postharvest management of seed, seed treatment technologies, seed processing, and seed storage. For faster and timely development, partnerships (public and private) at various levels (regional and international) are crucial. There is an urgent need to strengthen both formal and informal seed systems including characterization of environment to find suitable geographic regions for quality seed production. For seed certification, harmonization of various international seed certification schemes/programs and seed testing procedures are essential. This will also help in efficient and safe movement of seed. To influence seed trade, the effective management of intellectual property rights, sanitary and phytosanitary certificates in addition to management of trade barriers, are all of prime importance for growth of the seed industry. In both developed and developing nations, public investments in plant breeding and seed industry are on the decline. This trend needs to be reversed by emphasizing the need to increase research funding to all stakeholders of genetic resources and seed industry to develop strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural systems.

Fumonisins in Serbian Corn: Long-time Assessment under Actual Climate Change Conditions	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						maize; fumonisins; climate change; Serbia	FUSARIUM MYCOTOXINS; MAIZE SAMPLES; CONTAMINATION; ZEARALENONE; OCHRATOXIN; GENOTYPES; CEREALS	Maize samples collected in Serbia during a period of seven years were investigated on the presence of fumonisins. Concentration of fumonisins was determined by validated direct competitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay method. This method was in accordance with European Union requirements, therefore accredited and performed in the Serbian accredited official laboratory. Summary analysis of all obtained results revealed fumonisins contamination in 82% of the total of 291 maize samples with average contamination being 1.515 mg/kg. An increase in the percentage of contaminated samples (from 51 to 100%), as well as an increase in mean fumonisin concentration in positive samples (from 0.227 to 3.281 mg/kg) and median values in positive samples (from 0.070 to 2.140 mg/kg) was noticed during the observation period. Although in Serbia there is no regular control of fumonisins in corn for animal feeding, long-term results indicate their wide distribution in this grain. Since the data on climate elements show change in temperature and precipitation in relation to multiannual average on the territory of Serbia, further research on the effects of climate change on the development of mold, the appearance of insects and the production of toxins are necessary in order to check the resistance of currently grown hybrids in the territory of Serbia on fungal growth and fumonisins production.

We investigate a radiation of ten species of Sternopriscus, the most species-rich genus of epigean Australian diving beetles. These species are distinct based on genital morphology but cannot be distinguished readily by mtDNA and nDNA because of genotype sharing caused by incomplete lineage sorting. Their genetic similarity suggests a Pleistocene origin. Results: We use a dataset of 3858 bp of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to reconstruct a phylogeny of Sternopriscus using gene and species trees. Diversification analyses support the finding of a recent rapid speciation event with estimated speciation rates of up to 2.40 species per MY, which is considerably higher than the proposed average rate of 0.16 species per MY for insects. Additionally, we use ecological niche modeling and analyze data on habitat preferences to test for niche divergence between species of the recent Sternopriscus radiation. These analyses show that the species can be characterized by a set of ecological variables referring to habitat, climate and altitude. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the repeated isolation of populations in glacial refugia might have led to divergent ecological adaptations and the fixation of morphological traits supporting reproductive isolation and therefore may have promoted speciation. The recent Sternopriscus radiation fulfills many characteristics of a species flock and would be the first described example of an aquatic insect species flock. We argue that the species of this group may represent a stage in speciation past the species flock condition because of their mostly broad and often non-overlapping ranges and preferences for different habitat types.

J	Despres, L				Despres, Laurence			One, two or more species? Mitonuclear discordance and species delimitation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						climate change; contemporary evolution; hybridization; population genetics - theoretical; speciation	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; POPULATION	Delimiting species boundaries is central to understand ecological and evolutionary processes, and to monitor biodiversity patterns over time and space. Yet, most of our current knowledge on animal diversity and phylogeny relies on morphological and mitochondrial (mt) DNA variation, a popular molecular marker also used as a barcode to assign samples to species. For morphologically undistinguishable sympatric species (cryptic species), the congruence of several independent markers is necessary to define separate species. Nuclear markers are becoming more accessible, and have confirmed that cryptic species are widespread in all animal phyla (Fiser, Robinson, & Malard, 2018). However, striking differences between the mitochondrial and nuclear variation patterns are also commonly found within single species. Mitonuclear discordance can result from incomplete lineage sorting, sex-biased dispersal, asymmetrical introgression, natural selection or Wolbachia-mediated genetic sweeps. But more generally, the distinct mode of transmission of these two types of markers (maternal vs. biparental) is sufficient to explain their distinct sensitivity to purely demographic events such as spatial range and population size fluctuations over time. In a From the Cover manuscript in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hijonosa et al. (2019) show that highly divergent mtDNA lineages coexist in a widespread European butterfly (Figure 1). None of the hundreds of nuclear markers analyzed was associated with mt lineages, nor was Wolbachia variation. These findings rule out the presence of cryptic species but shed light on complex demographic history of lineage divergence/fusion during the Pleistocene climatic fluctuations, and pave the way to a better integration of both mt and nuclear information in demographic models.

Changing weather conditions during the study years significantly differentiated the percentage of maize plants damaged by pests and affected by diseases. The positive effect of the row method of NP fertiliser application in maize cultivation not only reduced plant infestation by Fusarium diseases, but also reduced Frit fly (Oscinella frit L.) pressure. The "stay-green" hybrid was characterized by a significantly lower susceptibility to feeding of the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hbn.) compared to the traditional cultivar. Sowing maize of the traditional cultivar using the direct sowing system increased damage to plants caused by Frit fry larvae (Oscinella frit L.) compared to sowing into soil cultivated in a traditional way. For the "stay-green" type, the method of soil preparation for sowing did not significantly affect the pressure of this pest. A simplified method of soil preparation for sowing maize should give preference to cultivating "stay-green" varieties.

Biologists have explained the evolution of these prime number period lengths in terms of resource limitation, enemy avoidance, hybridization and climate change. Here, I question two aspects of these explanations: that the origin of the life cycles was associated with Pleistocene ice age events, and that they evolved from shorter life cycles through the lengthening of nymphal stages in annual increments. Instead, I suggest that these life cycles evolved earlier than the Pleistocene and involved an abrupt transition from a nine-year to a 13-year life cycle, driven, in part, by interspecific competition.

Marine environments are widely addressed as a serious threat to coastal concrete structures due to higher repair and rehabilitation costs. The rising concerns of climate change and related issues also require marine structures to be resilient and sustainable at the same time. Geopolymer concrete has been given more significant consideration as an alternative, reporting better resistance to harsh and hazardous environmental exposure, including sulphate attacks, chloride attacks, and freeze-thaw climates. This study investigated the mechanical properties of fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS)-based self-compacting geopolymer concrete (SCGC), subjected to short term ambient and marine curing conditions. The mechanical performance, inclusive of compressive strength, tensile strength, and modulus of elasticity under three-month marine exposure compared to an ambient environment, indicates that the SCGC mix offered an increase in strength. It is reported that the compressive strength of SCGC increased to the range of 50 MPa after marine exposure in comparison to the 40 MPa strength after 28-day curing. A similar increase in indirect tensile strength and modulus of elasticity were observed for the test specimens, with no signs of leaching of salts under marine exposure. Thus, the current SCGC acts as a sustainable construction material in counteracting the threats of marine degradation in civil structural components.

Using a novel assessment framework to evaluate protective functions and timber production in Austrian mountain forests under climate change	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE			English	Article						Protective forests; PICUS; Mountain forests; Ecosystem services; Forest management	BARK BEETLE INFESTATION; SPATIALLY EXPLICIT; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; ROCKFALL MODULE; NORWAY SPRUCE; LIDAR DATA; LAND-USE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; DYNAMICS	In Central European mountain forests, timber production and the protection of infrastructure and settlements against gravitational natural hazards are key forest ecosystem services (ES). The quantitative assessment of mountain forest ES for management planning and decision support is a particular challenge, due to manifold involved spatial scales from tree to slope and landscape level. We present an assessment framework to analyze and communicate the effect of management and climate change on the provision of selected ES in mountain forests. Core element is the spatially explicit hybrid forest ecosystem model PICUS. Remote sensing data and inventories are combined to generate realistic fine-grained forest landscapes with single tree resolution as input to PICUS. Landscape-level planning of silvicultural prescriptions employs geographic information systems functionalities (locate skyline corridors and treatment areas, prescribe silvicultural operations based on tree-level attributes) and produces management maps, which are interpreted by PICUS and executed in course of simulation runs. Model output is imported into a spatially explicit landscape assessment tool to assess the protective effect of vegetation. In a 250 ha case study in the Eastern Alps in Austria, the assessment framework is demonstrated to evaluate effects of climate change and management on timber production and protection against landslides and snow avalanche release. Climate change had, depending on climate and management scenario both, positive and negative impacts on desired ES. Key factor for ES provisioning in the case study was the interaction of bark beetle disturbances, legacies of past land-use practices and forest management.

Accurate wheat yield prediction is critical to satisfying local consumption and increasing exports regionally and globally to meet human food security. This paper incorporates remote satellite-based information in a wheat-growing region in South Australia to estimate the yield by integrating the kernel ridge regression (KRR) method coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the grey wolf optimisation (GWO). The hybrid model, 'GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR,' employing an initial pool of 23 different satellite-based predictors, is seen to outperform all the benchmark models and all the feature selection (ant colony, atom search, and particle swarm optimisation) methods that are implemented using a set of carefully screened satellite variables and a feature decomposition or CEEMDAN approach. A suite of statistical metrics and infographics comparing the predicted and measured yield shows a model prediction error that can be reduced by ~20% by employing the proposed GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model. With the metrics verifying the accuracy of simulations, we also show that it is possible to optimise the wheat yield to achieve agricultural profits by quantifying and including the effects of satellite variables on potential yield. With further improvements in the proposed methodology, the GWO-CEEMDAN-KRR model can be adopted in agricultural yield simulation that requires remote sensing data to establish the relationships between crop health, yield, and other productivity features to support precision agriculture.

Termites in the genus Macrotermes have been reported as a major challenge to Eucalyptus plantation forestry establishment. The current study evaluated the susceptibility of four Eucalyptus hybrid clones: GU 7, GC 796, GC 550 and GC 796/2, and E. grandis Hill ex Maid. to the most damaging Macrotermes bellicosus (Smeathman) and Macrotermes subhyalinus (Rambur) to identify tolerant material that can be planted in high incidence areas. The study involved exposure of moisture dry pieces of wood from E. grandis and the four hybrid clones to damage by M. bellicosus and M. subhyalinus. Results confirmed that M. bellicosus is the most aggressive. Results further revealed that E. grandis and GC 550 are the most susceptible whereas GC 796 is the most tolerant clone. The findings from the study will contribute to improved management of termites by planting tolerant material in high risk areas.

Long-term cloud forest response to climate warming revealed by insect speciation history	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Coleoptera; hybridization; Last Glacial Maximum; Quaternary climate; speciation; trade&#8208; wind inversion	SPONTANEOUS MUTATION-RATE; DEMOGRAPHIC HISTORY; HYBRID ZONES; DIVERGENCE; DIVERSITY; DEFORESTATION; VULNERABILITY; CHOICE; IMPACT; GENUS	Montane cloud forests are areas of high endemism, and are one of the more vulnerable terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Thus, understanding how they both contribute to the generation of biodiversity, and will respond to ongoing climate change, are important and related challenges. The widely accepted model for montane cloud forest dynamics involves upslope forcing of their range limits with global climate warming. However, limited climate data provides some support for an alternative model, where range limits are forced downslope with climate warming. Testing between these two models is challenging, due to the inherent limitations of climate and pollen records. We overcome this with an alternative source of historical information, testing between competing model predictions using genomic data and demographic analyses for a species of beetle tightly associated to an oceanic island cloud forest. Results unequivocally support the alternative model: populations that were isolated at higher elevation peaks during the Last Glacial Maximum are now in contact and hybridizing at lower elevations. Our results suggest that genomic data are a rich source of information to further understand how montane cloud forest biodiversity originates, and how it is likely to be impacted by ongoing climate change.

Plantation forests, climate change and biodiversity	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Conservation; Forestry; Landscape ecology; Indirect effects; Climate/global change	PINE PROCESSIONARY MOTH; MIXED-SPECIES PLANTATIONS; HYBRID POPLAR CLONES; PLANTED FORESTS; RESTORATION PLANTINGS; CARBON SEQUESTRATION; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; TEMPERATE FORESTS; POTENTIAL IMPACT; RIPARIAN BUFFERS	Nearly 4 % of the world's forests are plantations, established to provide a variety of ecosystem services, principally timber and other wood products. In addition to such services, plantation forests provide direct and indirect benefits to biodiversity via the provision of forest habitat for a wide range of species, and by reducing negative impacts on natural forests by offsetting the need to extract resources. There is compelling evidence that climate change is directly affecting biodiversity in forests throughout the world. These impacts occur as a result of changes in temperature, rainfall, storm frequency and magnitude, fire frequency, and the frequency and magnitude of pest and disease outbreaks. However, in plantation forests it is not only the direct effects of climate change that will impact on biodiversity. Climate change will have strong indirect effects on biodiversity in plantation forests via changes in forest management actions that have been proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the productive capacity of plantations. These include changes in species selection (including use of species mixtures), rotation length, thinning, pruning, extraction of bioenergy feedstocks, and large scale climate change driven afforestation, reforestation, and, potentially deforestation. By bringing together the potential direct and indirect impacts of climate change we conclude that in the short to medium term changes in plantation management designed to mitigate or adapt to climate change could have a significantly greater impact on biodiversity in such plantation forests than the direct effects of climate change. Although this hypothesis remains to be formally tested, forest managers worldwide are already considering new approaches to plantation forestry in an effort to create forests that are more resilient to the effects of changing climatic conditions. Such change presents significant risks to existing biodiversity values in plantation forests, however it also provides new opportunities to improve biodiversity values within existing and new plantation forests. We conclude by suggesting future options, such as functional zoning and species mixtures applied at either the stand level or as fine-scale mosaics of single-species stands as options to improve biodiversity whilst increasing resilience to climate change.

We propose a new deep learning hybrid model for SWL forecasting using convolutional neural networks (CNN), bi-directional long-short term memory (BiLSTM), and ant colony optimisation (ACO) with a two-phase decomposition approach at the 7-day, 14-day, and 28-day forecast horizons. The newly developed CBILSTM method is coupled with complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and variational mode decomposition (VMD) methods to extract the most significant features within predictor variables to build a hybrid CVMD-CBiLSTM model. We integrate three distinct datasets (satellite-derived, climate mode indices, and ground-based meteorological observations) to improve the forecasting capability of the CVMD-CBiLSTM model, applied at nineteen different gauging stations in the Australian Murray River system. This proposed model returns a significantly accurate performance with-98% of all prediction errors within less than +/- 0.020 m and a low relative root mean square of-0.08%, demonstrating its superiority over several benchmark models. The results show that using the new hybrid deep learning algorithm with ACO feature selection can significantly improve the accuracy of forecasted river water levels, and therefore, the method is attractive for adopting remote sensing data to the model ground-based river flow for strategic water savings planning initiatives and dealing with climate change-induced extreme events such as drought events.

In 2008, the exotic pest Leptocybe invasa (Hym: Eulophidae), known as the blue gum chalcid, was introduced in Brazil causing damage to eucalypt plantations in many regions of the country. To this end, this study evaluated the susceptibility of Eucalyptus camaldulensis (one seedlot), E. grandis (four seedlots), E. urophylla (four seedlots), and the "E. urograndis" hybrid (E. urophylla x E. grandis) (three seedlots) exposed to a natural infestation by L. invasa in two seasons (winter and summer). The attack on seedlings was classified in terms of severity as healthy (no pest attack), oviposition (only oviposition signs) and gall formation. The results show a significant higher pest incidence in summer compared to winter. Further, Eucalyptus urophylla was the least attacked and 90% of the seedlings were healthy whereas E. grandis showed the highest number of seedlings with galls. The E. urograndis hybrid showed intermediate results between the two species. Differences in susceptibility were observed between seedlots within species. Eucalyptus camaldulensis, which was expected to have the highest incidence of galls, had a high oviposition incidence (60%) and low gall incidence (< 10%), probably due to its provenance. The susceptibility of the different eucalypt families varied significantly with respect to L. invasa infestation, and family heritability ranged from 0.27 to 0.68. The genetic control of L. invasa is possible through the selection of tolerant and resistant material, considering the species, provenance, and family.

Density-dependent population dynamics of mountain pine beetle in thinned and unthinned stands	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH			English	Article							BARK TEMPERATURE PATTERNS; BLUE-STAIN FUNGI; LODGEPOLE PINE; COLEOPTERA-SCOLYTIDAE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; FOREST; RESISTANCE; INFESTATION; HYBRIDS; CANADA	Thinning, the selective removal of some trees from a forest, is one way forest managers can reduce the probability that a forest will be susceptible to attack by bark beetles. Although this method has been shown to be effective, it is not clear whether the effect arises when pre-outbreak populations are small or during the epidemic phase when outbreaks are growing. We adopted a population dynamics approach to determine if the effect of limit or basal area thinning could be observed in the form of differential beetle recruitment using lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. & C. Laws.) mortality data from previously published studies as a proxy measure of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) population size. We found that mountain pine beetle populations exhibit density-dependent population dynamics that are influenced by the silvicultural history of their host's stand. Thinning did not change the epidemic equilibrium but instead caused a shift in dynamics from linear to nonlinear. In a validation test, the models developed for thinned and unthinned stands predicted reproductive rates in independent locations.

A well-documented example of a range expansion during the past decades is provided by the European wasp spider Argiope bruennichi. Using ecological niche modeling, thermal tolerance experiments and a genome-wide analysis of gene expression divergence, we show that invasive populations have adapted to novel climatic conditions in the course of their expansion. Their climatic niche shift is mirrored in an increased cold tolerance and a population-specific and functionally differentiated gene expression response. We generated an Argiope reference genome sequence and used population genome resequencing to assess genomic changes associated with the new climatic adaptations. We find clear genetic differentiation and a significant admixture with alleles from East Asian populations in the invasive Northern European populations. Population genetic modeling suggests that at least some of these introgressing alleles have contributed to the new adaptations during the expansion. Our results thus confirm the notion that range expansions are not a simple consequence of climate change, but are accompanied by fast genetic changes and adaptations that may be fuelled through admixture between long separated lineages.

Phylogeny and evolution of large body size in the rove beetle genus Phlaeopterus Motschulsky, 1853 (Coleo-ptera: Staphylinidae: Omaliinae: Anthophagini)	ARTHROPOD SYSTEMATICS & PHYLOGENY			English	Article						Phlaeopterus; rove beetle; Staphylinidae; Vellica; Lesteva; Unamis; maximum likelihood; Bayesian; DNA barcoding	DNA; REVISION; WINGS	The omaliine rove beetle genus Phlaeopterus Motschulsky, 1853 contains 22 species. The genus is distributed across northwestern North America and eastern Asia. These beetles occur primarily along the edges of alpine snowfields and streams, habitats that are particularly sensitive to the impacts of climate change. Two species have not been collected since 1979 and 1984, one of which, Phlaeopterus bakerensis Mullen and Campbell, 2018, is a contender for the largest-bodied species among the over 1,600 species of the subfamily Omaliinae. Here, we present the first phylogeny of the genus, using Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses based on DNA sequences from the mitochondrial gene COI and morphological data. We tested previous taxonomic hypotheses and most were rejected by all three analyses. Phlaeopterus castaneus Casey, 1893 is non-monophyletic based on COI sequences and may have hybridized with P. loganensis Hatch, 1957. We found support for the monophyly of the genus Phlaeopterus. Our analyses suggest the common ancestor of the genus had small-bodied adults (maximum body size under 5 mm) with ocelli. Within this small-bodied radiation of species, ocelli were lost once and there were two separate evolutionary transitions to large-bodied adults. Although all the large-bodied species are snowfield-associated and only 25% of the small-bodied species are, we did not find statistical support for a relationship between large body size and use of snowfield habitats. These findings represent the first modern phylogenetic reconstruction of species-level relationships within the rove beetle subfamily Omaliinae using both morphological and molecular data.

Using wild relatives and related species to build climate resilience in Brassica crops	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Review								Climate change will have major impacts on crop production: not just increasing drought and heat stress, but also increasing insect and disease loads and the chance of extreme weather events and further adverse conditions. Often, wild relatives show increased tolerances to biotic and abiotic stresses, due to reduced stringency of selection for yield and yield-related traits under optimum conditions. One possible strategy to improve resilience in our modern-day crop cultivars is to utilize wild relative germplasm in breeding, and attempt to introgress genetic factors contributing to greater environmental tolerances from these wild relatives into elite crop types. However, this approach can be difficult, as it relies on factors such as ease of hybridization and genetic distance between the source and target, crossover frequencies and distributions in the hybrid, and ability to select for desirable introgressions while minimizing linkage drag. In this review, we outline the possible effects that climate change may have on crop production, introduce the Brassica crop species and their wild relatives, and provide an index of useful traits that are known to be present in each of these species that may be exploitable through interspecific hybridization-based approaches. Subsequently, we outline how introgression breeding works, what factors affect the success of this approach, and how this approach can be optimized so as to increase the chance of recovering the desired introgression lines. Our review provides a working guide to the use of wild relatives and related crop germplasm to improve biotic and abiotic resistances in Brassica crop species.

Long-term cloud forest response to climate warming revealed by insect speciation history (vol 75, pg 231, 2021)	EVOLUTION			English	Correction						Coleoptera; hybridization; Last Glacial Maximum; Quaternary climate; speciation; trade' wind inversion		Montane cloud forests are areas of high endemism, and are one of the more vulnerable terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Thus, understanding how they both contribute to the generation of biodiversity, and will respond to ongoing climate change, are important and related challenges. The widely accepted model for montane cloud forest dynamics involves upslope forcing of their range limits with global climate warming. However, limited climate data provides some support for an alternative model, where range limits are forced downslope with climate warming. Testing between these two models is challenging, due to the inherent limitations of climate and pollen records. We overcome this with an alternative source of historical information, testing between competing model predictions using genomic data and demographic analyses for a species of beetle tightly associated to an oceanic island cloud forest. Results unequivocally support the alternative model: populations that were isolated at higher elevation peaks during the Last Glacial Maximum are now in contact and hybridizing at lower elevations. Our results suggest that genomic data are a rich source of information to further understand how montane cloud forest biodiversity originates, and how it is likely to be impacted by ongoing climate change.				bemerson@ipna.csic.es	Karger, Dirk Nikolaus/ABD-5181-2021						1	0	0	2	7	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0014-3820	1558-5646		EVOLUTION	Evolution	MAY	2021	75	5					1239	1239		10.1111/evo.14225		APR 2021	1	Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Evolutionary Biology; Genetics & Heredity	SA3HQ		Green Submitted, Bronze			2022-05-30	WOS:000635984400001

Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)]. Since its first detection outside of its native range in 2016, FAW has spread into 76 nations across Africa and Asia adversely affecting maize production and, in turn, the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers. Thus, there is a strong need for the development of cost-effective and biologically based integrated pest management (IPM) practices including host-plant resistance (HPR). However, most of the commercial maize cultivars have lost some defensive traits through selective breeding for yield during domestication. The majority of the commercially cultivated hybrids and cultivars in Asia and Africa are highly susceptible to FAW. Therefore, this review summarizes information about various maize landraces, native germplasm, and crop wild relatives (CWRs) possessing FAW resistance traits and about their potential resistance mechanisms, namely antibiosis, antixenosis, and tolerance. There is clear evidence of FAW resistance acting through diverse mechanisms in several maize landraces, germplasm lines, native populations, and CWRs such as Antigua race, FAW Tuxpeno, Zapalote Chico 2451F, Doce Flor da Serra, FAWCC (C5), CMS 14C, PopG (C2), MpSWCB-4, Mp708, Mp 704, CML 67, and FAW 7050, as well as a few species of teosinte and Tripsacum L. Further, a scheme that outlines strategies and approaches for prebreeding and their introgression into elite cultivars for developing FAW-resistant maize is proposed as a possible way forward.

For some species, the genetic distinctness of isolated populations is maintained during secondary contact, while for others, admixture is frequently observed. For the winter moth (Operophtera brumata), an important defoliator of oak forests across Europe and northern Africa, we previously determined that contemporary populations correspond to genetic diversity obtained during the last glacial maximum (LGM) through the use of refugia in the Iberian and Aegean peninsulas, and to a lesser extent the Caucasus region. Missing from this sampling were populations from the Italian peninsula and from North Africa, both regions known to have played important roles as glacial refugia for other species. Therefore, we genotyped field-collected winter moth individuals from southern Italy and northwestern Tunisia-the latter a region where severe oak forest defoliation by winter moth has recently been reported-using polymorphic microsatellite. We reconstructed the genetic relationships of these populations in comparison to moths previously sampled from the Iberian and Aegean peninsulas, the Caucasus region, and western Europe using genetic distance, Bayesian clustering, and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods. Our results indicate that both the southern Italian and the Tunisian populations are genetically distinct from other sampled populations, and likely originated in their respective refugium during the LGM after diverging from a population that eventually settled in the Iberian refugium. These suggest that winter moth populations persisted in at least five Mediterranean LGM refugia. Finally, we comment that outbreaks by winter moth in northwestern Tunisia are not the result of a recent introduction of a nonnative species, but rather are most likely due to land use or environmental changes.

Consequently, cold-adapted alpine species can be trapped in interglacial Holocene refugia on high mountain summits if they fail to expand their ranges to the north. One example is the alpine grasshopper Stenobothrus cotticus. This species was assumed to be endemic to the southwestern Alps (France, Italy). However, we have found a second refugium in the Rila Mountains in southwestern Bulgaria. Analyses of the mitochondrial gene co1 and of phenotypic characters from morphology and behaviour did not reveal differences between the two geographically separated populations of S. cotticus studied. We suppose that S. cotticus had a wider distribution during colder periods, when its range was expanded to lower altitudes. This hypothesis is supported by the current distribution of the closely related montane S. rubicundulus.

As the susceptibility of individual trees to dependent organisms is often genetically determined, it is possible that these genetic changes may extend beyond individuals to affect associated communities. To test this, we examined how variation in crossing distance among the progeny of 18 controlled crosses of Norway spruce (Picea abies) populations occurring across central Sweden affected chemical defense, and subsequently, a small community of galling Adelges aphids infecting planted trees at two common garden trails. Although crossing distance did not influence growth, vitality or reproduction in the studied population, it did influence the expression of one candidate defensive chemical compound, apigenin, which was found in higher concentrations within outcrossed trees. We also show that this variation in apigenin induced by crossing distance correlated with susceptibility to one member of the galling community but not the other. Furthermore, the effect of crossing distance on galling communities and the general susceptibility of Norway spruce to infection also varied with environment. Specifically, in the more benign environment, inbred trees suffered greater gall infection than outcrossed trees, which is contrary to general predictions that the effects of inbreeding should be more pronounced in harsher environments. These findings suggest that the effects of variation in crossing distance in forest trees can extend beyond the individual to influence whole communities.

Best of both worlds: hybrids of two commercially important pines (Pinus contorta x Pinus banksiana) combine increased growth potential and high drought tolerance	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH			English	Article						tree improvement; forest genetics; seed orchards; climate change; drought response; hybridization; resilience	LODGEPOLE PINE; JACK PINE; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; LONG-TERM; RESPONSES; IMPROVEMENT; STRATEGIES; RESISTANCE; SEEDLINGS	Over 18 million hectares of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var. latifolia Engelm.) forests have been affected by a massive mountain pine beetle outbreak in western Canada. The ensuing need for reforestation compels forest managers to deploy more drought-resistant stock in anticipation of a hotter and drier future climate. Recent studies suggest that naturally occurring lodgepole pine x jack pine (Pious banksiana Lamb.) hybrids may be more drought-resistant than pure lodgepole pine. We used single-nucleotide polymorphism markers to determine the level of jack pine introgression present in the region J lodgepole pine seed orchard, in northwest Alberta, and we identified six hybrid genotypes with 10%-18% jack pine introgression for further study. We compared the performance of open-pollinated seedlings of lodgepole, jack, and hybrid pines under well-watered and drought conditions in a greenhouse experiment. Seedlings were subjected to repeg ated drought cycles, withholding water for either 2 or 3 weeks. We found that hybrid pines grew significantly faster than lodgepole pine under well-watered conditions while retaining the high tolerance to prolonged drought exhibited by lodgepole pine seedlings, a particularly beneficial combination of traits during the critical stage of establishment. We therefore suggest the deployment of hybrid lodgepole pine as a strategy to promote adaptation to hotter and drier future climates.

Here, the genus Rhododendron is one of the largest flowering plant genera. The flowering of rhododendrons across elevations in the Himalaya supports insects, birds, and animal movements seasonally. Their diverse life forms and habits also form an important structural component of diverse vegetation types from tropical to temperate forests and alpine thickets. Rhododendrons are also a source of livelihood for many rural communities in the Himalaya. The high ecological and economic significance of rhododendrons in this mountain region qualifies it as an important genus for further investigation and exploration. However, over time, climate change and the ever-increasing demand for natural resources have collectively exerted considerable pressure on Indian Himalayan rhododendrons in their natural habitats. Available data on various aspects of taxonomy, ecology and conservation status are scanty. There is an urgent need to assess the potential ecological and economic benefits that rhododendrons provide to local mountain communities and associated wildlife. This critical review provides comprehensive detail on taxonomy, evolutionary history, ecology, reproductive biology, hybridization, economic importance, impact of climate change on its ecology and evolution, and the conservation status of rhododendrons in the Indian Himalaya. Further, we conclude with a discussion of the strategies to be adopted for the conservation of Rhododendron-dominated forests in the Indian Himalaya. This comprehensive compilation will open new perspectives for future studies and improve ongoing conservation efforts to manage valuable plant resources.

Variability in the distribution of black cuticle and other colours was found to be much higher within populations than previously believed and it proved difficult to characterize any species, subspecies and even local population unequivocally using this feature alone. A representative sample of larvae from the Canary Islands, Madeira, North Africa, Iberia, Italy, Germany, Eastern Europe, Malta, Greece and Yemen, is illustrated, supplemented by observations from photographs of larvae from the Middle East and Western Asia. Taxonomy-independent definitions of larval morphotypes demonstrate significant overlap between species. We discuss the results in the context of Western Palaearctic biogeography, postulating several areas of hybridisation between the more northern Hyles euphorbiae and more southern H. tithymali that have led to the mosaic distribution patterns observed, and consider the potential of these moths for tracking the future effects of climate change in the Mediterranean Basin.

Adaptive evolutionary changes in cold tolerance can facilitate their establishment in new environments. Ambrosia artemisiifolia, a noxious invasive plant, occurs throughout China. Ophraella communa, a biological control agent of A. artemisiifolia, mainly occurs in southern China. However, in 2012, it established populations in Beijing (39.98 degrees N, 115.97 degrees E) following introduction from Laibin (23.62 degrees N, 109.37 degrees E), implying cold adaptation. The mechanisms underlying its rapid evolution of cold tolerance remain unknown. We investigated the levels of cryoprotectants and energy reserves in adult O. communa from two latitudes. In high-latitude insects, we found high trehalose, proline, glycerol, total sugar, and lipid levels; five potential genes (Tret1a, Tret1b, Tret1-2, P5CS, and GST), responsible for regulating cold tolerance and involved in trehalose transport, proline biosynthesis, and glutathione S-transferase activation, were highly expressed. These hybridisation changes could facilitate cold temperature adaptation. We demonstrate the genetic basis underlying rapid adaptation of cold tolerance in O. communa, explaining its extension to higher latitudes. Thus, specialist herbivores can follow host plants by adapting to new temperature environments via rapid genetic evolution.

Recent development of biotechnology theoretically allows for resistance enhancement that could help reduce these risks but we still lack a comprehensive understanding of benefits and tradeoffs with pest resistant GM (genetically modified) trees. We synthesized the current knowledge on the effectiveness of GM forest trees with increased resistance to herbivores. There is ample evidence that induction of exogenous Bacillus thuringiensis genes reduce performance of target pests whereas upregulation of endogenous resistance traits e.g., phenolics, generates variable results. Our review identified very few studies estimating the realized benefits in tree growth of GM trees in the field. This is concerning as the realized benefit with insect resistant GM plants seems to be context-dependent and likely manifested only if herbivore pressure is sufficiently high. Future studies of secondary pest species and resistance evolution in pest to GM trees should be prioritized. But most importantly we need more long-term field tests to evaluate the benefits and risks with pest resistant GM trees.

Norway has more than 400 watercourses with Atlantic salmon and supports a large proportion of the world's wild Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon are structured into numerous genetically differentiated populations, and are therefore managed at the population level. Long-distance migrations between freshwater and ocean habitats expose Atlantic salmon to multiple threats, and a number of anthropogenic factors have contributed to the decline of Atlantic salmon during the last decades. Knowledge on the relative importance of the different anthropogenic factors is vital for prioritizing management measures. We developed a semi-quantitative 2D classification system to rank the different anthropogenic factors and used this to assess the major threats to Norwegian Atlantic salmon. Escaped farmed salmon and salmon lice from fish farms were identified as expanding population threats, with escaped farmed salmon being the largest current threat. These two factors affect populations to the extent that they may be critically endangered or lost, with a large likelihood of causing further reductions and losses in the future. The introduced parasite Gyrodactylus salaris, freshwater acidification, hydropower regulation and other habitat alterations were identified as stabilized population threats, which have contributed to populations becoming critically endangered or lost, but with a low likelihood of causing further loss. Other impacts were identified as less influential, either as stabilized or expanding factors that cause loss in terms of number of returning adults, but not to the extent that populations become threatened. Management based on population specific reference points (conservation limits) has reduced exploitation in Norway, and overexploitation was therefore no longer regarded an important impact factor. The classification system may be used as a template for ranking of anthropogenic impact factors in other countries and as a support for national and international conservation efforts.

Concrete is one of the most widely used product in the planet. The development of new materials as alternative to cement could lay the foundations for introducing on the market innovative systems with higher performances and lower environmental impacts. The present research investigates, through a life cycle approach, the environmental impacts of the production process of aerated systems based on innovative Geopolymer-based Hybrid Foams (GHF), choosing as system boundary the method "cradle to gate". The environmental impacts of GHF derived from fly ash (GHF-FA) were compared to GHF based on metakaolin (GHF-MK) and commercial Aerated Autoclaved Concrete (AAC) system. The main result shows that GHF-FA has the lowest environmental impact (in terms of CO2 production), thus it appears as an environmentally friendly material. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Global climate models predict increasing environmental variance in the future. Yet we do not fully understand how environmental variation affects performance traits. Questions: Does temperature fluctuation during development affect adult size and wing shape in Drosophila melanogaster? If so, are the effects predictable? Do they depend on heterozygosity? Do fluctuations in developmental temperature affect adult physiological performance at high temperature? Methods: We tested the effect of one fluctuating (21 degrees C/29 degrees C) and several constant (21 degrees C, 23 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 29 degrees C) developmental temperature regimes on three wing morphometric traits (wing length, wing width, and wing shape) in an experiment using three inbred lines of D. melanogaster and their first-generation hybrids. We also tested the effect of fluctuating and constant developmental temperature on adult locomotor performance at several high and stressful test temperatures (32 degrees C, 34 degrees C, 36 degrees C, 38 degrees C, 40 degrees C). Results: Performance mostly declined if the flies were reared under the fluctuating temperature regime versus the constant temperature regime with the same mean (25 degrees C). Heterozygosity level also affected the traits investigated, with crossbreds usually having higher trait values. Crossbred genotypes compared across constant temperatures also showed greater plasticity in wing aspect. Conclusion: The widespread use of constant developmental temperatures in laboratory experiments may lead to overestimation of performance.

There is little evidence about maize growth and yield responses to high night temperature (HNT) under field conditions. In this study, we aimed to (i) evaluate the effect of HNT during post-flowering on kernel number (KN), crop growth rate expressed in chronological days and thermal units (CGR(D) and CGR(TU), respectively), radiation use efficiency (RUE), night respiration (Rn), net photosynthesis (Amax), chlorophyll fluorescence and cell membrane stability (CMS), and (ii) identify associations among the measured physiological traits. Two hybrids (Te, temperate; and St, subtropical) were exposed to two thermal conditions from R1 + 2d to R1 + 16d: (i) HNT from 1900 to 0700 h, and (ii) ambient night temperature (ANT). The HNT resulted in reductions in KN (8%), CGR(D) (11%), and CGR(TU) (19%), with non-significant changes in kernel weight and grain yield. Reductions in KN were better explained by drops in CGR(TU) than in CGR(D). Under HNT, Amax significantly decreased (p < 0.05; 17%, among experiments and hybrids) with insignificant changes in CMS and chlorophyll fluorescence. HNT caused a larger effect on Rn in Te (+40%) than in St. We found a strong negative relationship between Rn and Amax, indicating that high Rn might exhibit an indirect effect on Amax, altering carbon balance and growth.

Is Gene Flow Promoting the Reversal of Pleistocene Divergence in the Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli)?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NUTHATCH SITTA-CAROLINENSIS; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; POPULATION-GENETICS; ICE AGES; HAPLOTYPE RECONSTRUCTION; STATISTICAL-METHOD; DNA POLYMORPHISM; FLYING SQUIRRELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HALDANES RULE	The Pleistocene glacial cycles left a genetic legacy on taxa throughout the world; however, the persistence of genetic lineages that diverged during these cycles is dependent upon levels of gene flow and introgression. The consequences of secondary contact among taxa may reveal new insights into the history of the Pleistocene's genetic legacy. Here, we use phylogeographic methods, using 20 nuclear loci from regional populations, to infer the consequences of secondary contact following divergence in the Mountain Chickadee (Poecile gambeli). Analysis of nuclear data identified two geographically-structured genetic groups, largely concordant with results from a previous mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA) study. Additionally, the estimated multilocus divergence times indicate a Pleistocene divergence, and are highly concordant with mtDNA. The previous mtDNA study showed a paucity of sympatry between clades, while nuclear patterns of gene flow show highly varied patterns between populations. The observed pattern of gene flow, from coalescent-based analyses, indicates southern populations in both clades exhibit little gene flow within or between clades, while northern populations are experiencing higher gene flow within and between clades. If this pattern were to persist, it is possible the historical legacy of Pleistocene divergence may be preserved in the southern populations only, and the northern populations would become a genetically diverse hybrid species.

Given the continuing expansion of air traffic, mitigation of aviation's climate impact becomes challenging but imperative. Among various mitigation options, hybrid-electric aircraft (HEA) have drawn intensive attention due to their considerable potential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., CO2). However, the non-CO2 effects (especially contrails) of HEA on climate change are more challenging to assess. As the first step to understanding the climate impact of HEA, this research investigates the effects on the formation of persistent contrails when flying with HEA. The simulation is performed using an Earth System Model (EMAC) coupled with a submodel (CONTRAIL), where the contrail formation criterion, the Schmidt-Appleman criterion (SAC), is adapted to globally estimate changes in the potential contrail coverage (PCC). We compared the HEA to conventional (reference) aircraft with the same characteristics, except for the propulsion system. The analysis showed that the temperature threshold of contrail formation for HEA is lower; therefore, conventional reference aircraft can form contrails at lower flight altitudes, whereas the HEA does not. For a given flight altitude, with a small fraction of electric power in use (less than 30%), the potential contrail coverage remained nearly unchanged. As the electric power fraction increased, the reduction in contrail formation was mainly observed in the mid-latitudes (30 degrees N and 40 degrees S) or tropical regions and was very much localized with a maximum value of about 40% locally. The analysis of seasonal effects showed that in non-summer, the reduction in contrail formation using electric power was more pronounced at lower flight altitudes, whereas in summer the changes in PCC were nearly constant with respect to altitude.

Multiscale, behavior-oriented and process-based models, or hybrids of the two, are typically applied with deterministic approaches which require considerable computational effort. In order to reduce the computational cost of modeling large spatial and temporal scales, input reduction and morphological acceleration techniques have been developed. Here we introduce a general framework for reducing dimensionality of wave-driver inputs to morphodynamic models. The proposed framework seeks to account for dependencies with global atmospheric circulation fields and deals simultaneously with seasonality, interannual variability, long-term trends, and autocorrelation of wave height, wave period, and wave direction. The model is also able to reproduce future wave climate time series accounting for possible changes in the global climate system. An application of long-term shoreline evolution is presented by comparing the performance of the real and the simulated wave climate using a one-line model.

Harnessing Diversity in Wheat to Enhance Grain Yield, Climate Resilience, Disease and Insect Pest Resistance and Nutrition Through Conventional and Modern Breeding Approaches	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Review						wheat; genetic diversity; introgressions; disease resistance; pest resistance; cisgenesis; genomic selection; nutritional quality	FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT; MARKER-ASSISTED INTROGRESSION; GENOMIC SELECTION ACCURACY; STEM RUST FUNGUS; PUROINDOLINE-B; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT; GLUTENIN SUBUNITS; MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS; CHROMOSOMAL LOCATION; PYRICULARIA-ORYZAE	Current trends in population growth and consumption patterns continue to increase the demand for wheat, a key cereal for global food security. Further, multiple abiotic challenges due to climate change and evolving pathogen and pests pose a major concern for increasing wheat production globally. Triticeae species comprising of primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools represent a rich source of genetic diversity in wheat. The conventional breeding strategies of direct hybridization, backcrossing and selection have successfully introgressed a number of desirable traits associated with grain yield, adaptation to abiotic stresses, disease resistance, and bio-fortification of wheat varieties. However, it is time consuming to incorporate genes conferring tolerance/resistance to multiple stresses in a single wheat variety by conventional approaches due to limitations in screening methods and the lower probabilities of combining desirable alleles. Efforts on developing innovative breeding strategies, novel tools and utilizing genetic diversity for new genes/alleles are essential to improve productivity, reduce vulnerability to diseases and pests and enhance nutritional quality. New technologies of high-throughput phenotyping, genome sequencing and genomic selection are promising approaches to maximize progeny screening and selection to accelerate the genetic gains in breeding more productive varieties. Use of cisgenic techniques to transfer beneficial alleles and their combinations within related species also offer great promise especially to achieve durable rust resistance.

TAXA IN RELATION TO POLLEN SEASONS	JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						meteorological factors; phenological phases; pollen season; Tilia	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORDATA MILL.; CALENDAR; LUBLIN; START	All lindens provide Apidae insects with nectar, pollen, and honeydew. Lindens are important melliferous trees in Poland. The first purpose of the study was to carry out phenological observations of the flowering in ten linden taxa. The second aim was to analyse the content of linden pollen grains in the air of Lublin. A correlation between the parameters of the pollen season and meteorological factors was also determined. This study was conducted in the city of Lublin located in the central-eastern part of Poland. The flowering phenophases were analysed, using the method developed by Lukasiewicz, during the growing seasons of 2012-2015. Aerobiological monitoring, which was based on the volumetric method, was carried out over the 2001-2014 time period. As shown in the study, the flowering period of all the analysed linden taxa lasted 7 weeks, on average, from June 7 to July 24. The average length of the flowering period of the investigated taxa and hybrids was in the range of 12-17 days. Their flowering periods overlapped. The atmospheric pollen season lasted, on average, from mid-June to the second 10-day period of July. The highest concentration of airborne pollen was noted at the end of June. The pollen season pattern was significantly affected by temperature and relative air humidity as well as by rainfall in May and June. The investigations indicate a 9-day acceleration of the pollen season, which may be associated with global warming.

To select and recommend salt-tolerant cultivars, extensive genotypic screening and examination of plants' morpho-physiological responses to salt stress are required. In this study, 18 prescreened maize hybrid cultivars were examined at the early growth stage under a hydroponic system using multivariate analysis to demonstrate the genotypic and phenotypic variations of the selected cultivars under salt stress. The seedlings of all maize cultivars were evaluated with two salt levels: control (without NaCl) and salt stress (12 dS m(-1) simulated with NaCl) for 28 d. A total of 18 morpho-physiological and ion accumulation traits were dissected using multivariate analysis, and salt tolerance index (STI) values of the examined traits were evaluated for grouping of cultivars into salt-tolerant and -sensitive groups. Salt stress significantly declined all measured traits except root-shoot ratio (RSR), while the cultivars responded differently. The cultivars were grouped into three clusters and the cultivars in Cluster-1 such as Prabhat, UniGreen NK41, Bisco 51, UniGreen UB100, Bharati 981 and Star Beej 7Star exhibited salt tolerance to a greater extent, accounting for higher STI in comparison to other cultivars grouped in Cluster-2 and Cluster-3. The high heritability (h(bs)(2), > 60%) and genetic advance (GAM, > 20%) were recorded in 13 measured traits, indicating considerable genetic variations present in these traits. Therefore, using multivariate analysis based on the measured traits, six hybrid maize cultivars were selected as salt-tolerant and some traits such as Total Fresh Weight (TFW), Total Dry Weight (TDW), Total Na+, Total K+ contents and K+-Na+ Ratio could be effectively used for the selection criteria evaluating salt-tolerant maize genotypes at the early seedling stage.

To understand the divergence process of 13-year and 17-year cicada life cycles, we studied genetic relationships between two synchronously emerging, parapatric 13-year periodical cicada species in the Decim group, Magicicada tredecim and M. neotredecim. The latter was hypothesized to be of hybrid origin or to have switched from a 17-year cycle via developmental plasticity. Phylogenetic analysis using restriction-site-associated DNA sequences for all Decim species and broods revealed that the 13-year M. tredecim lineage is genomically distinct from 17-year Magicicada septendecim but that 13-year M. neotredecim is not. We detected no significant introgression between M. tredecim and M. neotredecim/M. septendecim thus refuting the hypothesis that M. neotredecim are products of hybridization between M. tredecim and M. septendecim. Further, we found that introgressive hybridization is very rare or absent in the contact zone between the two 13-year species evidenced by segregation patterns in single nucleotide polymorphisms, mitochondrial lineage identity and head width and abdominal sternite colour phenotypes. Our study demonstrates that the two 13-year Decim species are of independent origin and nearly completely reproductively isolated. Combining our data with increasing observations of occasional life cycle change in part of a cohort (e.g. 4-year acceleration of emergence in 17-year species), we suggest a pivotal role for developmental plasticity in Magicicada life cycle evolution.

The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonusponderosae) epidemic that swept through North American forests from the late 1990sthrough the early 2010s was one of the largest such disturbance events on record and triggered shocks to ecological and economic systems. We analyze the policy and governance responses to this event by focusing on three national forests in the state of Colorado and on the agency responsible for their management, the U.S. Forest Service. We found that the event triggered the formation of new hybrid agency/nonagency organizations that contributed both legitimacy and capacity to address the most immediate threats to human safety and infrastructure. Despite the use of a highly networked governance structure, longstanding U.S. Forest Service institutions continued to heavily influence the scope of the response and the means for implementing management activities. We detected relatively limited institutional response at the level of the agency as a whole, even as regional- and local-scale institutions within Colorado showed greater dynamism. Indeed, the changes to agency institutions that were detected were largely consistent with institutional change trajectories already in place prior to the epidemic. Our study points to the importance of institutional persistence and path dependence in limiting the latitude for adaptation to social and environmental shocks.

The hybridization process involves downsizing the internal combustion engine to save weight and installation of an exhaust heat harvesting system composed of a harvester, a generator, lithium-ion traction battery, an electrical conversion system, and an electric motor. Novel calculations for a hybrid powertrain performance envelope are presented that estimate the upper limits to the degree of downsizing and mass of the harvester. An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has been proposed as a potential compact, high-efficiency harvester. Five hydrofluroolefins (which have no ozone depletion potential and very low global warming potential) are considered as organic fluids for the ORC. It is found that R-1336mzz(Z) performs best in this application. Each ORC design parameter is investigated, and an optimized design with 14.3% thermal efficiency is found. At this efficiency, the internal combustion engine may be downsized up to 34.5%. The fuel burn reduction at this degree of downsizing may be as high as 12.7-14.5%.

We investigated DNA sequence variation in four plastid markers (TrnH-psbA, ycf1, trnK-matKandPetD) of the seven species (three sections) occurring in Lebanon:Q. calliprinos, Q. infectoria, Q. kotschyana, Q. cedrorum, Q. cerris, Q. look, andQ. ithaburensis, in addition toQ. libaniandQ. cerrisfrom Syria, and possible hybrids. Among the four markers, theTrnH-psbAandtrnK-matKloci resulted in the best-resolved genealogies.Quercus calliprinoshaplotypes clearly belong to the west Asian-eastern Mediterranean 'WAHEA' lineage. Sect.Cerrishaplotypes are derived variants of the central Mediterranean 'Cerris-Ilex' lineage. Sect.Quercushaplotypes were less differentiated and in close connection with the Caucasian primary refugium of white oaks. Despite the low species-level resolution, a gradient in genetic diversity linked to the ecological plasticity of the sampled species was observed. A close relationship ofQ. lookwithQ. cerrisis confirmed.Quercus kotschyanaseems an ancient stock of closely related and disjunct oak of sect.Quercus. Finally, our results confirm the relevance of the Levant region as an important biogeographical crossroad between continents, and its key role in stimulating diversification and preservation of ancient genepools. Important areas in Lebanon that should be taken into consideration in future conservation strategies are highlighted, to ensure a wider genetic potential of local oak species to face the current climate change.

The paper proposes a multiobjective model capable of finding a set of trade-off solutions for the joint optimization problem, considering the cost of reserve and curtailment of power from renewable sources. Managing a hybrid power system is a challenging task due to its stochastic nature mixed with the objective function and complex practical constraints associated with it. A novel metaheuristic Equilibrium Optimizer (EO) algorithm incepted in the year 2020 utilizes the concept of control volume and mass balance for finding equilibrium state is proposed here for computing the optimal schedule and impact of renewable energy integration on profit and emission for different optimization objectives. In this paper, EO has shown dominant performance over well-established metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and artificial bee colony (ABC). In addition, EO produces well-distributed Pareto-optimal solutions and the fuzzy min-ranking is used as a decision maker to acquire the best compromise solution.

However, costs of production are much higher, mainly due to more stringent demands for soil and climatic conditions, crop management, primary processing and control of several pests and diseases including the potentially very destructive coffee leaf rust (CLR) and berry disease (CBD). Breeding for disease resistance in combination with vigour, productivity and quality started in the early 1920s in India, but especially in the second half of the 20th century comprehensive breeding programmes have been implemented in several other coffee producing countries. Many of the resulting CLR- and CBD + CLR-resistant cultivars (true-breeding lines and F1 hybrids) meet the required standards of profitable and sustainable crop production. Challenges of more recent date include limited access to additional genetic resources of Coffea arabica, breakdown of host resistance to CLR, aggravating insect pest problems and the increasingly negative impact of climate change on arabica coffee production worldwide. This review discusses prospects of breeding and disseminating next generation (hybrid) cultivars of arabica coffee for sustainable coffee production under changing conditions of diseases, pests and climate. International networking on coffee breeding will facilitate sharing of resources (financial, genetic) and scientific information, application of genomics-assisted selection technologies, and pre-breeding for specific characters. Breeding and multiplication of new cultivars well adapted to the local environment will continue to be carried out at national or regional levels. A tree crop like arabica coffee does not lend itself to centralized variety development and dissemination on a global scale.

Forest genomics: Advancing climate adaptation, forest health, productivity, and conservation	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						assisted gene flow; cyberinfrastructure; forest management; genomic selection; hybridization; insect and disease resistance; landscape genomics; nonmodel species; tree breeding	MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE; ASSISTED GENE FLOW; EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; LOCAL ADAPTATION; SELECTION; TRAITS; TREES	Forest ecosystems provide important ecological services and resources, from habitat for biodiversity to the production of environmentally friendly products, and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Humanity is counting on forests to sequester and store a substantial portion of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide produced globally. However, the unprecedented rate of climate change, deforestation, and accidental importation of invasive insects and diseases are threatening the health and productivity of forests, and their capacity to provide these services. Knowledge of genetic diversity, local adaptation, and genetic control of key traits is required to predict the adaptive capacity of tree populations, inform forest management and conservation decisions, and improve breeding for productive trees that will withstand the challenges of the 21st century. Genomic approaches have well accelerated the generation of knowledge of the genetic and evolutionary underpinnings of nonmodel tree species, and advanced their applications to address these challenges. This special issue of Evolutionary Applications features 14 papers that demonstrate the value of a wide range of genomic approaches that can be used to better understand the biology of forest trees, including species that are widespread and managed for timber production, and others that are threatened or endangered, or serve important ecological roles. We highlight some of the major advances, ranging from understanding the evolution of genomes since the period when gymnosperms separated from angiosperms 300 million years ago to using genomic selection to accelerate breeding for tree health and productivity. We also discuss some of the challenges and future directions for applying genomic tools to address long-standing questions about forest trees.

A Critical Review of Power Take-Off Wave Energy Technology Leading to the Conceptual Design of a Novel Wave-Plus-Photon Energy Harvester for Island/Coastal Communities' Energy Needs	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						wave energy; solar photovoltaics plant; wavevoltaics; hybrid wave photon energy converter; land-use conflicts; hybrid renewable energy	MAGNET LINEAR GENERATOR; LATCHING CONTROL STRATEGIES; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; WELLS TURBINE; HEAVING-BUOY; CONVERTER; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; DEVICE; IMPLEMENTATION	As the global interest in renewable energy generation continues, the need to develop new and innovative solutions is being explored every day throughout the world by researchers and innovators. Hybrid renewable energy innovations are gaining progressive interest not only because of the threat of climate change but also due to the technological advancements seen in renewables. Ocean waves have immense potential as a renewable energy source, and related technologies have advanced continuously over the past few decades. In response, this paper extensively studies wave energy converters (WECs) based on the power take-off (PTO) technique, and presents a novel hybrid wave-plus-photon energy (HWPE) harvester called Wavevoltaics, based on wave and solar energy capture systems for coastal communities' power needs, in line with decarbonization measures. The HWPE harvester uses a simple rack-and-pinion mechanism in combination with solar cell technology to convert the wave energy into usable electrical energy in a water column structural design. This novel HWPE device can be used to provide power for lighting and gadgets for coastal communities that rely heavily on fossil fuels for their lighting and electrical needs. Later in the paper, the challenges faced in hybrid wave energy development are presented.

Characterizing the physical and genetic structure of the lodgepole pine jack pine hybrid zone: mosaic structure and differential introgression	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Review						environmental modeling; hybridization; jack pine; lodgepole pine; Pinus banksiana; Pinus contorta	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA MINISATELLITE; MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; LATE-QUATERNARY HISTORY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; RANGE EXPANSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BANKSIANA COMPLEX; NATURAL HYBRIDIZATION; WESTERN INTERIOR; BOREAL FOREST	Understanding the physical and genetic structure of hybrid zones can illuminate factors affecting their formation and stability. In north-central Alberta, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb) form a complex and poorly defined hybrid zone. Better knowledge of this zone is relevant, given the recent host expansion of mountain pine beetle into jack pine. We characterized the zone by genotyping 1998 lodgepole, jack pine, and hybrids from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Minnesota at 11 microsatellites. Using Bayesian algorithms, we calculated genetic ancestry and used this to model the relationship between species occurrence and environment. In addition, we analyzed the ancestry of hybrids to calculate the genetic contribution of lodgepole and jack pine. Finally, we measured the amount of gene flow between the pure species. We found the distribution of the pine classes is explained by environmental variables, and these distributions differ from classic distribution maps. Hybrid ancestry was biased toward lodgepole pine; however, gene flow between the two species was equal. The results of this study suggest that the hybrid zone is complex and influenced by environmental constraints. As a result of this analysis, range limits should be redefined.

More than 75% of the world's rice is grown under flooded conditions. However, the long-term sustainability of this flooded system is threatened by the rapid changes in climatic events causing erratic rainfall and abiotic stresses, looming water and energy crisis, low nitrogen use efficiency, increasing micronutrient deficienties, increasing labor costs and reduced labor availability, increased methane emissions, yield stagnation, and the negative effects of rice crops on post-rice crops. The narrow genetic background in rice has also slowed the pace of breeding rice cultivars tolerant to abiotic and biotic stresses which has resulted in yield stagnation. While direct-seeded rice has become popular in developed countries, saving water and labor resources and reducing methane emissions, developing countries in Asia struggle to disseminate direct seeding technologies due to the lack of government support and policy. Weed management in direct seeded rice is still a major bottle neck in wide scale adoption of this rice system in developing world. Mechanical transplanting of rice is gaining momentum in Asia, reducing labor requirements, ensuring timely transplantation, and saving water during initial growth. Nonetheless, government support and strong policy are needed to boost its uptake by providing subsidies to purchase mechanical transplanters and training farmers to use this technology. With deteriorating soil health due to continuous cultivation of rice with cereals in rotation, overuse of synthetic fertilizers, and increased co-occurrence of abiotic and biotic stresses in rice, there is a need to adopt integrated crop management techniques, and to identify genes of interest and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for their introgression into desired plants. These interventions will improve the improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in rice. There is also a need for extensive campaign and policy support from the government to force farmers to harvest their rice crops using specific rice harvesters that can save the yield losses that occur when using wheat combine harvesters-a common practice in many developing countries.

Selecting hardwood taxa for wood and fibre production in Queensland's subtropics	AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY			English	Article						plantations; site-species matching; climate; adaptation; survival; growth; borers; Corymbia; Eucalyptus	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; AUSTRALIA; PERFORMANCE	Optimal matching of species to sites is required for a sustainable hardwood plantation industry in the subtropics. This paper reports the performance and adaptation of 60 taxa (species, provenances and hybrids) across two rainfall zones and a range of soil types in southern Queensland. Specifically, performance of taxa is compared across five replicated taxon-site matching trials at age 6 y. Three trials are in a 1000-mm y(-1) rainfall zone of the Wide Bay region near Miriam Vale and two in a drier (about 750 mm y(-1)) rainfall zone near Kingaroy in the South Burnett region. In the higher-rainfall zone, the taxa with the fastest growth in the three trials at age 6 y were Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata Woondum provenance, which ranked 1st, 6th and 5th respectively; E. longirostrata Coominglah provenance, ranked 3rd, 2nd and 3rd; and two sources of E. grandis, Copperlode provenance (ranked 4th and 1st) and SAPPI seed orchard (ranked 6th and 4th), which were planted in only two of the three trials. Similarly, in the lower-rainfall zone, E. grandis and its hybrids appear promising from the 6-y growth data., This excellent early growth, however, has not continued in either rainfall zone, with these taxa, 8 y after planting, now showing signs of stress and mortality. Based on trial results in these two rainfall zones, the taxon that appears the most promising for sustainable plantation development with high average annual volume index values and low incidence of borer attack is Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (6.7 m(3) ha(-1)). Eucalyptus grandis and E. longirostrata both have better average annual volume indexes (8.2 m(3) ha(-1) and 7.4 m(3) ha(-1) respectively) but are very susceptible to borer attack. The current and long-term productivity and sustainability of plantation forestry in these rainfall zones is discussed. Further, the implications of predicted climate change (particularly reduced rainfall) for growing trees for fibre production and carbon sequestration are explored.	[Lee, D.

Basal cold but not heat tolerance constrains plasticity among Drosophila species (Diptera: Drosophilidae)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						cold tolerance; heat shock; phenotypic plasticity; phylogenetic constraint; rapid cold hardening; thermotolerance	THERMAL LIMITS DEPEND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; HARDENING CAPACITY; HSP70 EXPRESSION; CHILL COMA; INTERSPECIFIC HYBRIDIZATION; LATITUDINAL GRADIENT; LABORATORY SELECTION; LOW-TEMPERATURE	Thermal tolerance and its plasticity are important for understanding ectotherm responses to climate change. However, it is unclear whether plasticity is traded-off at the expense of basal thermal tolerance and whether plasticity is subject to phylogenetic constraints. Here, we investigated associations between basal thermal tolerance and acute plasticity thereof in laboratory-reared adult males of eighteen Drosophila species at low and high temperatures. We determined the high and low temperatures where 90% of flies are killed (ULT90 and LLT90, respectively) and also the magnitude of plasticity of acute thermal pretreatments (i.e. rapid cold-and heat-hardening) using a standardized, species-specific approach for the induction of hardening responses. Regression analyses of survival variation were conducted in ordinary and phylogenetically informed approaches. Low-temperature pretreatments significantly improved LLT90 in all species tested except for D. pseudoobscura, D. mojavensis and D. borealis. High-temperature pretreatment only significantly increased ULT90 in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. LLT90 was negatively correlated with low-temperature plasticity even after phylogeny was accounted for. No correlations were found between ULT90 and LLT90 or between ULT90 and rapid heat-hardening (RHH) in ordinary regression approaches. However, after phylogenetic adjustment, there was a positive correlation between ULT90 and RHH. These results suggest a trade-off between basal low-temperature tolerance and acute low-temperature plasticity, but at high temperatures, increased basal tolerance was accompanied by increased plasticity. Furthermore, high-and low-temperature tolerances and their plasticity are clearly decoupled. These results are of broad significance to understanding how organisms respond to changes in habitat temperature and the degree to which they can adjust thermal sensitivity.

Different types of activators were used, including solids (Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaOH) and liquids(Na(2)SiO(3)xH(2)O). The results highlight the possibility of obtaining an eco-efficient, hybrid cement with compressive strengths of up to 102 MPa at 28 days and reductions of up to 73% in the global warming potential (expressed in kg.

Under laboratory conditions, the psyllid Aphalara itadori has demonstrated its potential to be a successful biocontrol agent for F. japonica. However, this potential has not materialised in the field where long-term establishment of A. itadori has been unsuccessful and faces the added challenge of climate change. Intraspecific variation (variation among individuals of a species) has been shown to support establishment in alien species and improve resilience to changing environmental conditions. Here we propose it could improve the performance of biocontrols. To test this possibility we compared the performance and impact on F. japonica of three strains of A. itadori with different genetic backgrounds, including a newly created hybrid. We hypothesize that genetic variability would be increased in hybrids resulting in greater biocontrol effectiveness (greater impact on plant growth). We also explored the potential influence of changing climate on performance, testing all strains under two humidity conditions (with the same temperature). Contrary to our expectation, the hybrid strain had the worst performance (slowest development rate and lower survival from egg to adult emergence) under both environmental conditions. Exposure to different strains of A. itadori did not result in consistent differences in plant growth, suggesting similar biocontrol effectiveness among strains. Under the drier, more stressful, conditions plants exposed to A. itadori had fewer leaves and accumulated less above-ground biomass. Overall, our results suggest that genetic variability may not be the key to improve A. itadori biocontrol effectiveness, but that predicted climate change, which anticipates drier and hotter summers in the UK, could reduce the growth potential of F. japonica when exposed to A. itadori.

In addition, recent droughts reduced the amount of available water behind the hydropower dams to provide the water head needed to run the turbines in hydropower plants. A more sustainable alternative, instead of developing new infrastructure, is to enhance the daily operation of reservoirs to support hydropower generation. This study suggests a new optimal operation policy for Folsom Reservoir in California and hydropower plants, which maximizes hydropower generation and reduces flood risk. This study demonstrates the application of the cellular automata (CeA) approach to optimize the daily hydropower operation of Folsom Reservoir. The reservoir operation is a nonlinear problem, where the hydropower generation and elevation-area-storage functions are the main nonlinearity to accurately represent the daily operation of the system. Moreover, the performance of the CeA approach under two extreme climate conditions, wet and dry, was evaluated and compared to the operation during normal conditions. Results showed that the CeA approach provides more efficient solutions in comparison to the commonly used evolutionary optimization algorithms. For the size of the non-linear optimization problem designed in this study, CeA outperformed genetic algorithm for finding optimal solutions for different climate conditions. Results of CeA showed that although the annual average inflow to the reservoir during the dry period was about 30% less than the normal condition, CeA offered about a 20% reduction in average hydropower generation. The new operation policy offered by CeA can partly compensate for the loss of the snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada under a warming climate. The approach and its outcomes support an informed decision-making process and provide practical reservoir operational guideline to remediate the adverse effects of hydroclimatic changes in the future.

In this paper we reviewed the current knowledge about the changes in the interplay between environment (with its components climate and human activity), pathogens and host plants that drive fungal EIDs of forest trees. We described seven groups of drivers that may be involved individually or together, at once or successively, in the emergence of an infective disease, and we illustrated them by examples. In the past century plant EIDs mostly resulted from the introduction of alien pathogens to new geographic areas as a consequence of international trade (i). However, other factors also played an important role, as for instance climate change (ii), which acts as a strong evolutionary force potentially enhancing the fitness or driving the expansion of the distribution range of pathogens, and/or weakening host plants i.e. predisposing them to infection. Global trade made geographically isolated pathogens spread beyond their natural range and hybridize with related species. Hybridization (iii) between previously isolated fungal pathogens has driven the emergence of new organisms with different and/or wider host range than the parental species. In some cases EIDs were caused by a hypervirulent strain of a known pathogen or by a completely new species, whose origin is still unclear (iv), which might be due to the development of novel traits or the acquisition of virulence from other species through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The sudden appearance of unforeseen diseases may be driven by cryptic disease agents, i.e. microorganisms indistinguishable from known species except for unapparent traits involved in pathogenesis, by pathogens with an extended latency period, or by endophytes capable of turning into pathogens after environment changes (v). New associations between introduced insect vectors and native tree pathogens (vi), or vice versa, may result into more efficient transmission and extended host- or geographic range of pathogens. The global use of intensively managed forest plantations (vii) of non-native trees or of a small number of clones of the same species over huge areas has increased the attacks by pathogens, which were accidentally introduced and/or adapted to new hosts. While the idea of totally preventing new EIDs appears unrealistic, it may be possible to reduce their occurrence, and the related damages and costs, by managing the drivers of disease emergence.

To clarify the delimitation and the evolutionary history of the two main European Monochamus species, Monochamus galloprovincialis and Monochamus sutor, as well as their sub-species, a comparative study using morphological, molecular, and biogeographical criterions was conducted. Four morphological characters, including a newly-described morphological character on the male genitalia, separated the two species. Additionally, molecular data revealed twelve and two single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytochrome oxidase c subunit I and 28S, respectively, supporting species segregation. By contrast, incongruence between morphological and genetic results did not allow discriminating the sub-species of M.galloprovincialis and M.sutor, even though mitochondrial DNA revealed intraspecific differentiation, mostly consenting to a multiple refugia origin. Within-species variability was explained to a large extent by biogeography (i.e. altitude, climate). These different ecological adaptations within beetle species, together with potential climate change impact, increase the risk of spreading the nematode across Europe to novel conifer hosts and challenge the European biosecurity.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 354376.

Biological Flora of the British Isles: Ophrys sphegodes	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						calcareous grasslands; conservation; dispersal; germination; mycorrhiza; Ophrys; Orchidaceae; pollination; seed characteristics	SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; EARLY SPIDER ORCHID; POPULATION BIOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLLINATION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; MIMICRY; PHYLOGENETICS; TEMPERATURE	This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Ophrys sphegodes Mill. that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Native to Britain, O. sphegodes used to be more widely distributed throughout south-eastern England, but is now mainly restricted to the counties of Dorset, East Sussex and Kent. It is widespread throughout the western parts of central and southern Europe, and is common in Spain, France and Italy. Further east, it occurs in Bulgaria and Greece, including most of the Mediterranean islands, and extends into southern Russia, Turkey and northern Iran.Ophrys sphegodes grows on calcareous, nutrient-poor substrates and rarely under any shade. It is most common in ancient, heavily grazed grassland on chalk and Jurassic limestone, but it also occurs in disturbed habitats, horizontally oriented rock floors in limestone quarries, on old limestone quarry spoil heaps, and in lightly trampled calcareous grasslands on maritime cliffs.Ophrys sphegodes multiplies predominantly by sexual reproduction. Vegetative multiplication occasionally occurs through survival or splitting of the old tuber. In the UK, the species is almost exclusively pollinated by males of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea. Male bees are attracted by complex floral bouquets emitted by the flowers that strongly resemble pheromones produced by female A.nigroaenea. Fruit production is generally low, and in most populations, <15% of the flowers produce capsules.Ophrys sphegodes is reproductively isolated from other species in the genus by strong pre-mating barriers, most notably temporal (differences in flowering time) and floral (different pollinators) isolation. In particular, differences in floral odour appear to underlie floral isolation. Nonetheless, several hybrids involving O.sphegodes have been described in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. The range of O.sphegodes in Britain declined dramatically in the twentieth century, leading to its extinction in twelve vice-counties. Losses were mainly due to ploughing of grassland and changes in fertilizer and grazing regimes. Its range has increased somewhat in recent years. However, increases in spring temperature due to climate warming may seriously threaten the species in Britain by disrupting the close relationship between O.sphegodes flowering time and the phenology of flight of its prime pollinator, leading to reproductive failure.

One aspect of US climate policy that is particularly contentious is the issue of the best economic tool to employ to reduce emissions: a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system. This unnecessarily polarized debate has damaged the effectiveness of climate policy supporters in securing climate legislation. The logical way forward is a hybrid of the two policies-an approach incorporated in some of the recent climate bills, though it was not properly explained or highlighted. This approach would be a practical starting point when the United States next takes up a climate bill, the author writes.											18	1	1	0	22	ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD	ABINGDON	2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND	0096-3402	1938-3282		B ATOM SCI	Bull.

Such renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydro based energies, etc. are environment friendly and have potential to be more widely used. Combining these renewable energy sources with back-up units to form a hybrid system can provide a more economic, environment friendly and reliable supply of electricity in all load demand conditions compared to single-use of such systems. One of the most important issues in this type of hybrid system is to optimally size the hybrid system components as sufficient enough to meet all load requirements with possible minimum investment and operating costs. There are many studies about the optimization and sizing of hybrid renewable energy systems since the recent popular utilization of renewable energy sources. In this concept, this paper provides a detailed analysis of such optimum sizing approaches in the literature that can make significant contributions to wider renewable energy penetration by enhancing the system applicability in terms of economy.

Location Western Palaearctic. Methods We incorporated sequence data from dense sampling of the phylogeographically important Anatolian region with both previous and newly obtained data of the nuclear fragment cpnl-1 and the mitochondrial fragment COI-tRNALeu-COII. In total, 1049 sequences of cpnl-1 from 33 regions were analysed to investigate the genetic diversity, genetic structuring and phylogeography of C. parallelus across its distributional range. The mtDNA region was additionally used to test whether the Turkish Straits system acts as a barrier. Results The analyses revealed that not all southern refugial populations of C. parallelus have contributed equally to the post-glacial recolonization of Europe. Four genetic clusters across the species' range were recovered: cluster A (eastern part of the Anatolian Diagonal); cluster B (western part of the Anatolian Diagonal); cluster C (Spain, Italy, southern Balkans, west part of Anatolia and Russia); and cluster D (covering the entire distributional range of the species). The Turkish Straits system has been a weak barrier to dispersal by C. parallelus, allowing gene flow from Anatolia to the Balkans. Main conclusions The current patterns of genetic structuring of C. parallelus were best explained by multiple expansion and contraction events. Anatolia has been well connected to the Balkans, contributing genetically to the establishment of central and northern European populations prior to the Holocene. The Anatolian refugium is suggested to be the centre of origin for Western Palaearctic C. parallelus diversity rather than a Balkan refugium.	[Korkmaz, E.

Morpho-Physiological and Genomic Evaluation of Juglans Species Reveals Regional Maladaptation to Cold Stress	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						cold hardiness; interspecific F1 hybrids; Juglans; signature of selection; Carpathian walnut	ELECTROLYTE LEAKAGE; GENE-EXPRESSION; BLACK-WALNUT; REGIA L.; HARDINESS; RESISTANCE; TREES; ACCLIMATION; ARABIDOPSIS; DIVERSITY	Climate change may have unpredictable effects on the cold hardiness of woody species planted outside of their range of origin. Extreme undulations in temperatures may exacerbate susceptibility to cold stress, thereby interfering with productivity and ecosystem functioning. Juglans L. and their naturally occurring interspecific F1 hybrids, are distributed natively across many temperate regions, and J. regia has been extensively introduced. Cold hardiness, an environmental and genetic factor yet to be evaluated in many native and introduced Juglans species, may be a limiting factor under future climate change and following species introductions. We evaluated cold hardiness of native North American and Eastern Asian Juglans along with J. regia genotypes using field data from the Midwestern United States (Indiana), controlled freezing tests, and genome sequencing with close assessment of Juglans cold hardy genes. Many Juglans species previously screened for cold-hardiness were genotypes derived from the Midwest, California, and Europe. In 2014, despite general climate adaptation, Midwestern winter temperatures of -30 degrees C killed J. regia originating from California; however, naturalized Midwestern J. regia survived and displayed low damage. Hybridization of J. regia with black walnut (J. nigra) and butternut (J. cinerea) produced F1s displaying greater cold tolerance than pure J. regia. Cold hardiness and growth are variable in Midwestern J. regia compared to native Juglans, East Asian Juglans, and F1 hybrids. Phylogeny analyses revealed that J. cinerea sorted with East Asian species using the nuclear genome but with North American species using the organellar genome. Investigation of selected cold hardy genes revealed that J. regia was distinct from other species and exhibited less genetic diversity than native Juglans species Average whole genome heterozygosity and Tajima's D for cold hardy genes was low within J. regia samples and significantly higher for hybrid as well as J. nigra. We confirmed that molecular and morpho-physiological data were highly correlated and thus can be used effectively to characterize cold hardiness in Juglans species. We conclude that the genetic diversity within local J. regia populations is low and additional germplasm is needed for development of more regionally adapted J. regia varieties.

While direct climatic effects have been intensively studied, indirect effects, such as increasing hybridization risk, are poorly understood. The goal of our study was to analyse the impact of climate on population dynamics of a rare habitat specialist, Chorthippusmontanus, as well as the fine-scale spatial overlap with a sympatric habitat generalist, Chorthippus parallelus and the dispersion of hybrids. We wereparticularly interested in the role of spatiotemporal overlap on heterospecific encounter frequencies. We conducted high-precision mark-recapture studies on two sites over 7years and genotyped 702 individuals of two C.montanus generations to detect hybrids. We tested the performance of three programs (structure, newhybrids and adegenet) and accepted only hybrids detected by the two best performing programs. We then tested for correlations between yearly population trends and climatic variables. Furthermore, we analysed the spatial dispersion of both taxa and the hybrids to calculate variation in spatial and temporal overlap and infer heterospecific encounter probabilities. Our results revealed that droughts during the egg phase and rainy weather during nymphal development were strongly correlated with population declines in the habitat specialist. The highest hybridization rate (196%) was found in the population with lowest population size. The combined effects of spatial and temporal niche overlap decreased heterospecific encounter probabilities to 42-76% compared to 20-28% and 11-19% calculated alone from phenology or spatial overlap respectively. Hybrids were detected in areas of higher heterospecific encounter probability, mainly at the edge of the specialists' occupied habitat in areas with intermediate soil moisture conditions compared to the parental species. This illustrates that the combination of spatial and temporal segregation provides an effective barrier to hybridization. However, the high hybridization rate in one of the populations suggests that this function may decrease with decreasing population size. This supports the hypothesis that climatic extremes threaten rare species directly by reducing reproductive success and may indirectly increase hybridization risk. A is available for this article.

To introgress genes from Sinapis alba, a wild relative of Brassicaceae, into Brassica juncea, a cultivated member of this family, we initially produced somatic hybrids between the two species and then produced a large number of backcross populations involving the two somatic hybrids (H1 and H2) with Brassica juncea. BC1 progeny were morphologically very similar. However, when they were challenge inoculated with a highly virulent Alternaria brassicae (ITCC No. 2542) culture under in vivo and in vitro conditions in two growing seasons, they showed wide variations in their disease reaction. Of the 40 BC1 lines tested in one season, 36 showed a resistant reaction. BC1F2 progenies derived from these resistant BC1 plants also showed resistance to Alternaria brassicae, indicating stable inheritance of the resistant phenotype. However, BC1F2 progenies showed a wide variation in morphological traits, including plant height, basal branching, leaf thickness, trichome density on leaves and stem. BC1 plants were examined by genomic in-situ hybridization (GISH) to determine their chromosome constitution. All five plants were found to possess 12 strong hybridization signals upon hybridization with a FITC-labeled S. alba-specific probe. GISH studies on BC1F2 plants indicated localized signals in addition to 12 full chromosome hybridization signals, suggesting alien introgressions into B. juncea that requires further validation. The BC2 generation was found to possess half of the haploid set of alien chromosomes. The BC1F2 and BC2 generations were further screened against A. Brassiceae and found to be resistant/tolerant.

Quantification of the Environmental Benefits of Ultrafine/Nanotitanium Dioxide Photocatalyst Coatings for Concrete Pavement Using Hybrid Life-Cycle Assessment	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Titanium dioxide; Sustainable concrete pavement construction; Life-cycle assessment; Life-cycle inventory	NANO-PARTICLES; TIO2; REMOVAL; SURFACE	The use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) ultrafine particulates as coating for concrete pavement have received considerable attention in recent years as these coatings can trap and absorb organic and inorganic air pollutants by a photocatalytic process. Despite these promising benefits, the promotion of TiO2 coatings based on a single factor such as air quality does not provide a complete evaluation of this technology and may omit critical environmental factors that should be considered in the selection of sustainable materials. The objective of this study was to determine the life-cycle assessment of TiO2 coating technology based on a hybrid life-cycle methodology. To achieve this objective, a life-cycle inventory that quantifies the energy, abiotic raw material inputs, and emission of TiO2 coatings from cradle to grave were developed. Based on this inventory, life-cycle impact assessment of TiO2 coatings for concrete pavement was conducted using the BEES impact assessment model. The use of titanium dioxide coating reduces the concentration of harmful pollutants by a photocatalytic process, and therefore, reduces the environmental impacts in four main categories: acidification, eutrophication, criteria air pollutants, and smog formation. However, during the production phases and due to the consumption of fossil energy, titanium dioxide will cause an increase in global warming, fossil fuel depletion, water intake, ozone depletion, and impacts on human health. Based on the overall environmental performance of this product, life-cycle assessment shows that titanium dioxide coating has an overall beneficial effect on the environment.

Here, we evaluate vegetation carbon turnover processes in GVMs participating in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP, including HYBRID4, JeDi, JULES, LPJml, ORCHIDEE, SDGVM, and VISIT) using estimates of vegetation carbon turnover rate (k) derived from a combination of remote sensing based products of biomass and net primary production (NPP). We find that current model limitations lead to considerable biases in the simulated biomass and in k (severe underestimations by all models except JeDi and VISIT compared to observation-based average k), likely contributing to underestimation of positive feedbacks of the northern forest carbon balance to climate change caused by changes in forest mortality. A need for improved turnover concepts related to frost damage, drought, and insect outbreaks to better reproduce observation-based spatial patterns in k is identified. As direct frost damage effects on mortality are usually not accounted for in these GVMs, simulated relationships between k and winter length in boreal forests are not consistent between different regions and strongly biased compared to the observation-based relationships. Some models show a response of k to drought in temperate forests as a result of impacts of water availability on NPP, growth efficiency or carbon balance dependent mortality as well as soil or litter moisture effects on leaf turnover or fire. However, further direct drought effects such as carbon starvation (only in HYBRID4) or hydraulic failure are usually not taken into account by the investigated GVMs. While they are considered dominant large-scale mortality agents, mortality mechanisms related to insects and pathogens are not explicitly treated in these models.

Various cultivation techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects of drought, heat and/or salinity stresses on potato. Developing innovative varieties with relevant tolerance to abiotic stress is absolutely necessary to guarantee competitive production under sub-optimal environments. Commercial varieties are sensitive to abiotic stresses, and substantial changes to their higher tolerance levels are not easily achieved because their genetic base is narrow. Nonetheless, there are several other possibilities for genetic enhancement using landraces and wild relatives. The complexity of polysomic genetics and heterozygosity in potato hamper the phenotype evaluation over abiotic stresses and consequent conventional introgression of tolerance traits, which are more challenging than previous successes shown over diseases and insects resistances. Today, potatoes face more challenges with severe abiotic stresses. Potato wild relatives can be explored further using innovative genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches. At the field level, appropriate cultivation techniques must be applied along with precision farming technology and tolerant varieties developed from various breeding techniques, in order to realize high yield under multiple stresses.

Changes in phenology can drastically modify the evolutionary trajectory of a population, while a shift in the reproductive time may cause allochronic differentiation. The hypothesis of heritable reproductive time was experimentally tested, by studying a unique population of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Den. & Schiff.) which has a shifted phenology, and however co-occurs with the typical population following the classical life cycle. When populations of both types were reared under controlled conditions, the reproductive time was maintained asynchronous, as observed in the field. The shifted population was manipulated in the laboratory to reproduce later than usual, yet the offspring emerged in the next year at the expected dates thus coming back to the usual cycle. Hybrids from crosses performed between the 2 populations showed an intermediate phenology. From the emergence times of parents and offspring, a high heritability of the reproductive time (h = 0.76) was observed. The offspring obtained from each type of cross was genetically characterized using microsatellite markers. Bayesian clustering analysis confirmed that hybrids can be successfully identified and separated from the parental genetic classes by genotyping. Findings support the hypothesis that, for this particular population, incipient allochronic speciation is due to a heritable shift in the reproductive time that further causes assortative mating and might eventually cause ecological adaptation/maladaptation in response to environmental changes.

J	Raut, AN; Gomez, CP				Raut, Ashwin Narendra; Gomez, Christy Pathrose			Assessment of thermal and energy performance of thermally efficient sustainable wall system for Malaysian low cost housing	APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Thermal performance of building envelope has been of great Importance in determining the indoor thermal environment mainly due to the impact of existing global warming issues. Thus there is a need to provide wall system with better thermal performance than conventional wall systems. The focus of the research is to tackle the twin issues of sustainability and thermal performance of building wall systems for low-cost housing. Fiber reinforced mortar (FRM), and thermally enhanced sustainable hybrid (TESH) bricks were developed by optimizing the mix design using Glass Powder, Palm Oil Fly Ash, and Oil Palm Fibers. Both the FRM and TESH bricks, which constitute the TESH wall system, were analyzed for physical, mechanical and thermal performance and they comply with the various codes of practice for building materials. Heat transfer simulation was performed to determine the thermal performance of the newly developed TESH. The temperature distribution and rate of heat transfer through the wall system was found to be significantly lower than conventional wall systems. Also, the energy consumption analysis suggested 10.6% energy reduction for TESH wall system over conventional wall system. The total energy costing for the building was also reduced by 10.2% for TESH wall system.

Established and new technologies reduce increasing pest and pathogen threats to Eucalypt plantations	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Eucalyptus; Diseases; Insects; Invasion biology; DNA techniques; Genetics	SOUTH-AFRICA; CRYPHONECTRIA-CUBENSIS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; CANKER PATHOGEN; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; PISSODES-STROBI; SEED ORCHARD; RESISTANCE; FOREST; CHRYSOPORTHE	Plantation forestry based on Eucalyptus spp. has grown dramatically during the past 100 years, mainly in the tropics and southern hemisphere where these trees are non-native. Early plantations were affected by pests and pathogens, although damage was generally minimal. This is a situation that is changing dramatically with serious pest and pathogen problems now emerging regularly and often times causing very serious damage. Given the growing movement of people and products around the world, this is a trend that is certain to continue and the threat of diseases and insect damage is now seen as one of the most important constraints to the future sustainability of Eucalypt plantation forestry globally. While this is a very troubling situation, there are also reasons to be optimistic. Established technologies such as breeding and selection of disease and insect resistant species and hybrids; enhanced through vegetative propagation have already shown substantial promise to reduce damage. Likewise, biological control is being effectively used to reduce damage due to invasive alien insect pests. New technologies including DNA-based tools for identification, detection and monitoring of pest and pathogens are increasingly valuable. Similarly, the growing availability of genome sequences for Eucalypts and for their pests and pathogens will increasingly add to our capacity to reduce damage. While there are unknown dangers such as the impact of climate change on the damage caused by pests and pathogens, we believe that continual and realistic investment in technology will ensure long term sustainability of Eucalypt plantation forestry. Failure to invest wisely will result in the collapse of plantation enterprises and concomitant loss in investments. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Risk is affected by potentially interacting factors of maize genetics, ear feeding with insects, fungal inoculum and growth, and weather (rainfall, temperature, and humidity). This review gives special attention to integration of the most efficient pest and disease management strategy combinations and the potential interaction of insect ear feeding and A. flavus occurrence. Management strategies reviewed include maximizing partial genetic resistance to A. flavus and selection of appropriate hybrids for the area, biological control of A. flavus using non-aflatoxigenic strains, avoiding pests and diseases using cultural practices like early planting, and reducing H. zea and S. frugiperda ear injury using Bt transgenes. Understanding the combined influences and identifying combined management approaches may lead to reduced aflatoxin risk and maintaining yield.This review focuses on subtropical areas of North America because the amount of maize produced in warm environments within or similar to subtropical maize production areas is likely to increase due to projected increases in demand for maize and predicted increases in temperature may increase pest and disease risk.

A review on plant diversity and forest management of European beech forests	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH			English	Review						Temperate deciduous forests; Management; Nature conservation; Tree diversity; Palaeo-history; Pest species; Climate change	PETRAEA MATT. LIEBL.; FAGUS-SYLVATICA L.; SPECIES RICHNESS; ECOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; GERMANY COLEOPTERA; SAPROXYLIC BEETLES; DECIDUOUS FORESTS; NORTH-WESTERN; DOUGLAS-FIR	The impact of historical and present drivers on forest biodiversity is poorly understood. A better understanding is mandatory to ensure conservation and appropriate management of biodiversity and ecosystem functions in the face of climate warming and increasing demand for wood products. Here, we assess forest management strategies for maintaining plant biodiversity in Central European beech forests, with a focus on Germany. We show that (1) diversity of the German vascular plant flora increased exponentially during the Holocene reaching 3874 species mainly through apomictic and hybrid speciation. Vascular plant species confined to forests comprise about 10 % of this flora. No loss in vascular plants restricted to forests occured over the past 250 years despite of forest management; (2) the indigenous arboreal flora has a low diversity (64 tree species) compared with other continents due to environmental changes in the last 2 million years; (3) forest management has maintained a high plant diversity in the past. It should be an aim of silviculture to ensure this in the future; and (4) only 22 of the indigenous tree species are commercially used; nine of these commercially used species are threatened by diseases. We introduce the concept of palaeo-neophytes to address genera that existed in Central Europe during the latest Cenozoic. The introduction of species of palaeo-neophytic genera and sub Mediterranean species is discussed as a measure to buffer negative effects on native species caused by climate change and spread of novel diseases.

The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) are two existing market-based measures (MBMs) for addressing aviation emissions, whose implementation has been affected by the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article aims to examine challenges that the pandemic has posed on both systems by assessing the policy options for revising the EU ETS provisions on aviation, as well as the political debates regarding amendment to the CORSIA design in June 2020. Key policy insights From the environmental, economic and international perspectives, none of the six policy options proposed in the Inception Impact Assessment regarding future implementation of CORSIA alongside the EU ETS is optimal to achieving the EU's multiple goals in revising its ETS. This article recommends the adoption of a hybrid option, which would help maintain international intra-EU/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) flights under the EU ETS scope to achieve EU climate targets and at the same time still integrate some features of CORSIA's design in implementation. Concerning the reduction of free allowances for aviation, the swift phase-out option should be considered in conjunction with plans to develop sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). While long-term effects of the pandemic on the effectiveness of CORSIA remain to be seen, its immediate impacts can be noticed in the weakening of this scheme's credibility and stability in implementation.

Industrial symbiosis (IS) could generate both economic and environmental benefits in clustered industries and communities. This research shed light on how industrial symbiosis contributes to city's low-carbon development. An urban-level hybrid physical input and monetary output (HPIMO) model which covers physical energy inputs and air pollutants emissions, is established for addressing case study in a Chinese typical industrial city (Liuzhou). Based on current energy consumption and industrial symbiosis and the application of HPIMO model, scenarios related to industrial symbiosis, including waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling, flying ash recycling and biomass utilization are explored. Results show that compared with business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, IS can reduce solid wastes and further contribute to the co-benefits of energy saving, CO2 emissions reduction and air pollutants reduction. The finding is critical for national low-carbon strategy. Finally, policy implications to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China are proposed and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, this work aims to assess the biomass production for energy purposes in crops with short rotation, as well as its effect on soil properties. Deciduous tree species were used, mainly Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila L.), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and a hybrid poplar clone (Populus x euroamericana (Dode) Guinier, clone 'AF2'). Four field trials were implemented, under two different types of Mediterranean climate, where highly productive taxa were tested, in addition to the mixed planting of a nitrogen-fixing species with a non-fixing one. Short-rotation coppices (SRCs) of these taxa yield about 12-14 t ha(-1) year(-1) of high-quality dry woody biomass, when fertilizers and irrigation water are supplied; generate 205-237 GJ ha(-1) year(-1) net and earnings of about EUR 1.5 per EUR 1 invested; and sequester into the soil 0.36-0.83 t ha(-1) year(-1) of C and 57 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N. Therefore, these species raised as SRCs could improve degraded soils if the crop is properly managed, resulting in favorable economic, energy and CO2 emission balances. The use of mixed plantations can bring economic and environmental gains, and the biomass transformation into high-quality chips or pellets gives it added value.

Predicting spatio-temporal Culicoides imicola distributions in Spain based on environmental habitat characteristics and species dispersal	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Species dispersal; Species distribution model (SDM); Random Forests; Model testing; Variable importance; MODIS; Bluetongue; Veterinary epidemiology	BLUETONGUE VIRUS VECTORS; SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION; OBSOLETUS COMPLEX; RANDOM FORESTS; BITING MIDGES; SOIL-MOISTURE; MODELS; ABUNDANCE	The use of distance variables expressing the likelihood of species occurrence at a given site in relation to the distance to observed species presence is demonstrated to improve species distribution models, especially when combined with environmental variables which relate species occurrence to the environmental habitat characteristics. In this study we developed models to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of Culicoides imicola, which is the main transmission vector for the bluetongue virus in the Mediterranean region. We investigated (i) the importance of the environmental habitat characterization by means of bioclimatic variables, (ii) the effect of different distance variables to model the dispersal process, and (iii) the suitability of two different parameter identification procedures to determine the distance variables for species distribution modeling. Results showed that niche-based species distribution models, which only use environmental data, could estimate the occurrence of Culicoides imicola accurately, given that environmental data of the period of high species abundance (April until October) was included. The use of these models may therefore be hampered for predictive risk assessment aiming to estimate the probabilities and magnitude of undesired effects caused by the occurrence of C. imicola. Species distribution models accounting for species dispersal in addition to the environmental habitat characteristics, i.e. hybrid models, did provide accurate predictions of C. imicola distributions well before the onset of the season of high species abundance. A Gaussian or negative exponential function of the distance to presence locations was most suitable to model insect dispersal. The enhanced predictive capacity of these models potentially leads towards an increased model applicability in risk assessment and disease control. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The primary aim of this study was to compare the fitness of transgenic crop x wild hybrids with their parental types and a non-transgenic crop type in the field under enhanced temperature and humidity. RESULTS: Transgenic insect-resistant oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), wild brown mustard [B. juncea (L.) Czern et Coss.], their hybrids and non-transgenic B. napus were grown in such a way as to mimic field conditions after harvest under which volunteer plants might appear in agricultural settings. Factor analysis revealed that vegetative growth characteristics explained most of the observed differences among plant types. Wild brown mustard had the highest fitness during its entire life history. Hybrids had intermediate composite fitness and lowest reproductive fitness. The hybrid and the wild weed shared similar vegetative growth characteristics and seed dormancy in their respective progenies. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that there might be enhanced persistence of the transgene in warmer climates. The absence of fitness cost of the transgenes might allow transgenes to persist in ecosystems. These data will contribute to risk assessments of transgene persistence and weed management against the backdrop of global climate change.

A comparison of Landfire- and FIA-based estimates of change in aboveground live tree carbon in California's forests	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						climate change; California; forest carbon; carbon accounting; FIA; landfire	WESTERN UNITED-STATES; MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE; DYNAMICS; DISTURBANCE; EMISSIONS; WILDFIRE; TRENDS	Forests play a central role in addressing climate change, and accurate estimates of forest carbon are critical for the development of actions that reduce emissions from forests and that maximize sequestration by forests. Methodological challenges persist regarding how best to estimate forest carbon stocks and flux at regulatory-relevant scales. Using California, USA as a case study, we compare two approaches to stock-difference forest carbon estimation for aboveground live trees: one based on ground inventories and one on land cover classification of remotely-sensed data. Previous work using ground inventory data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis Program (FIA) showed net aboveground carbon (AGC) sequestration by live trees in California forests, while estimates using land cover classification from the Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (Landfire) showed net reductions in live tree AGC over a similar time period. We examined the discrepancy by re-analyzing the FIA inventory data through the lens of a category-change analysis based on Landfire. This analysis showed more than 50% of the live tree AGC in fewer than 4% of Landfire-equivalent categories and that the overwhelming majority (>80%) of forest area did not change height category between measurement periods. Despite the lack of categorical change, the majority of FIA plots increased in both 95th percentile tree height and in live tree AGC. These findings suggest that an approach based on observing categorical changes risks undercounting AGC sequestration resulting from growth and thus overstating the relative importance of AGC reductions that result from disturbances. This would bias AGC flux estimates downward, leading us to validate the conclusion that live trees in California were a net sink of aboveground carbon in the decade ending in 2016. Our findings suggest an inventory-based or hybrid approach is preferable to methods that depend on categorical bins for estimating AGC in disturbance-prone forest ecosystems.

Therefore, a reliable maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is essential to track the GMPP within an appropriate time. This article proposes a hybrid technique by combining an evolutionary optimization technique, namely the modified invasive weed optimization (MIWO) with the conventional P&O algorithm to enhance the search performance for the maximum power output of the PV system. MIWO executes in the initial stages of the tracking followed by the P&O at the final stages in the MPPT search process. The combined approach ensures faster convergence and better search to the GMPP under rapid climate change and PSCs. The search performance of the hybrid MIWO+P&O technique is examined on a standalone PV system through both MATLAB/Simulink environment and experimentally using dSPACE (DS1103)-based real-time microcontroller hardware setup. The performance of the proposed hybrid MPPT scheme is compared with the recent state-of-the-art MPPPT techniques. In addition, the small-signal analysis of the PV system is carried out to evaluate the loop robustness of the controller design. For a given set of system parameters, simulations for the small-signal model and robustness studies are analyzed to verify the results. The overall results justify the efficacy of the proposed hybrid MPPT algorithm.

We address a PSMP problem for a single machine system under Time-of-Use electricity tariff. We consider two objectives including the makespan that measures the service level and the total energy cost that measures the energy sustainability. Both objectives are considered in a bi-objective mathematical model that is further solved using a novel heuristic algorithm consisting of two layers based on the problem decomposition. The inner layer problem, which is solved by a branch & bound algorithm, is to optimise the decision variables of preventive maintenance and machine's setup. The outer layer problem, which is solved by a hybrid NSGA-II algorithm, is to optimise the sequence of jobs and the amount of inserted buffer time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm are demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments. The Pareto frontier can serve as a tool for managers to consider energy cost explicitly in making decisions. It is observed in some scenarios that reducing energy cost will not increase the makespan.

This study applied an integrated modelling approach to quantify the impacts of climate and land use scenarios on the macroinvertebrate community in Sixth Creek catchment, South Australia. Gradient forest (GF) determined flow as most important driver affecting macroinvertebrate assemblages, and identified most flow-sensitive species based on highest cumulative importance along flow gradients. A catchment model developed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulated flow under the following scenarios: (1) deforestation, (2) reforestation, (3) climate change, and (4) a 10% increased urbanisation as projected by local authorities over the next 30 years. The urbanisation scenario predicted a 2% increase of average flow compared to 17% flow increase predicted by the deforestation scenario. In contrast, diminished monthly flow was suggested by both the climate change scenarios due to declining precipitation and higher temperatures, and the reforestation scenario most likely due to declining surface run-off. In reforestation and climate change scenarios, SWAT results predicted the highest decline in flow during late autumn and late spring, which may shift this unusual permanent flowing stream towards intermittency. The Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA) was used to develop flow-driven models for population dynamics of taxa identified by GF as flow sensitive i.e. Hydrobiidae spp., Austrocerca tasmanica, Offadens spp., Cloeon spp., Micronecta spp. and Tasmanocoenis tillyardi based on 14 years of data monitored at a representative stream site of Sixth Creek. The HEA models achieved coefficients of determination r(2) between 0.85 and 0.97 for predicted vs. observed abundances. While the abundance of Cloeon spp. diminished in all scenarios, it was most affected by low flow predictions of the climate change scenario. Hydrobiidae spp. appeared most tolerant to altered flow conditions by reaching highest abundances at high flow conditions caused by deforestation and urbanisation. Overall, this study highlighted the non-linear response of species within the commonly used Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) grouping and a need to redirect focus of such studies from community to species level. The integrated modelling approach based on GF, SWAT and HEA proved to be suitable for simulating complex species-specific macroinvertebrate responses to relevant climate and land use scenarios. Learning more about these interrelationships is a prerequisite for sustainable catchment management.

Tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius A. Gray), a drought-and heat-tolerant species closely related to common bean (P. vulgaris L.), has long been employed by Native Americans for production in regions prone to abiotic stress. In addition to abiotic stress, common bacterial blight [caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. phaseoli (Smith) Dye] and seed weevils [Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say)] are widespread yield and storage constraints worldwide, respectively. TARS-Tep 22 (Reg. No. GP-288, PI 666350) and TARS-Tep 32 (Reg. No. GP-289, PI 666351) were developed by the USDA-ARS, the University of Puerto Rico Agricultural Experiment Station, and Colorado State University. The tepary bean germplasms were selected for multiple stress tolerances, including high-temperature and drought stresses and resistance to bacterial blight and seed weevils, and for larger seed size and more erect architecture. TARS-Tep 22 represents the first published release of improved tepary as a result of hybridization and selection, and TARS-Tep 32 is a single plant selection from a landrace (PI 477033) from Arizona. The use of this improved germplasm by farmers in production zones affected by abiotic and/or biotic stress or by breeding programs can potentially increase yields of this newly rediscovered crop.

Planting RR is of great significance to increase grain production and ensure food security. However, few reports are available on the response of RR varieties to greenhouse gas emissions. A field experiment was conducted to comprehensively estimate the CH4 and N2O emissions among RR varieties in Southwest China. Five varieties were adopted in the experiment: Hanyou 73 (HY), Taiyou 390 (TY), Jingliangyouhuazhan (JLY), Yuxiang 203 (YX), and Fengliangyouxiangyihao (FLY). The CH4 and N2O emissions from the RR seasons accounted for 23-24% and 10-27% of total emissions from the MR+RR seasons, respectively. The significant reduction in CH4 emissions during the RR seasons was caused by low temperature, short growth period, and low aboveground biomass. Considering both CH4 and N2O emissions, the global warming potential of JLY was as high as 10.95 t CO2-eq ha(-1) in the MR+RR seasons, but the total yields were significantly higher than those of other varieties by 8-16%, and thereby the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of JLY was the lowest at 1.10 t CO2-eq t(-1) yield. The findings demonstrate that JLY is a suitable ratoon rice variety with the highest yield and lowest GHGI. Furthermore, it is possible to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the innovation of high-yielding rice varieties to adapt to future climate changes and ensure food security.

Modelling tree mortality by bark beetle infestation in Norway spruce forests	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						biotic disturbance; modelling predisposition; picea abies; ips typographus; PICUS; PHENIPS	TYPOGRAPHUS L COL; IPS-TYPOGRAPHUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PICEA-ABIES; IMAGINAL DIAPAUSE; DEFENSE REACTIONS; CARBON BUDGET; TATRA MTS.; TEMPERATURE; MANAGEMENT	Disturbances play a major role in forest ecosystems, they are main constituents of forest dynamics and are often a relevant driver in forest management decisions. The European Spruce Bark Beetle (Ips typographus L. Col. Scol.) is one of the major biotic disturbances in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests. In this contribution a sub-model of disturbances by I. typographus was developed and integrated in the existing hybrid forest patch model PICUS v1.4. The new disturbance sub-model builds on a recently developed phenology model for risk assessment of outbreaks of I. typographus (PHENIPS) and elements from an existing predisposition assessment system (PAS). Model parameterisation was based on data from 28 Nor-way spruce stands in Austria. In a preliminary model evaluation a comprehensive sensitivity analysis at sites along an elevation gradient in the Eastern Alps is presented. Sensitivity over the elevation gradient was found to be highest and strongly nonlinear with regard to the thermal environment. Furthermore, in accordance with general expectations and observations simulated damages were high under colline and submontane conditions and strongly decreased over the elevation transect. Based on the results of the simulation experiments it is concluded that the presented model is a promising tool to analyse the dynamic interaction of disturbances by I. typographus, environmental conditions and forest structure as affected by natural forest development and management interventions. Limitations of the model and possible approaches for extensive validation against empirical damage data are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Cradle to Gate" assessment of material related embodied carbon: A design stage stratagem for mid-rise housing in Sri Lanka	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Embodied carbon; Cradle-to-Gate assessment; Materiality; Critical building component	CO2 EMISSIONS; HYBRID LCA; ENERGY; BUILDINGS	Achieving low carbon buildings is seen as a key concept in order to reduce carbon emission and mitigate climate change. In contrast to operational emission, material related embodied carbon (EC) in the built environment plays a pivotal role, with the continuous consumption of high carbon emitting materials. This research relates to the 'Cradle-to-Gate' system boundary, while limiting its focus on building design stage decisions. A hybrid analysis approach was adopted a bottom-up process with steps encompassing mass analysis, EC calculation, highlighting carbon hotspots, and ultimately the identification of critical building components. As a case study, multi-storey housing was selected as a critical building typology, in Sri Lanka. The results reveal 'walls' as a carbon hotspot that needs to be explored in strategies for mitigation. Substantial EC savings were seen in the selection of fly ash blocks as an alternate material to clay brick or cement block. Changes to the configuration of walls, specifically, bonding patterns and non inclusion of a plaster layer, also showed savings. This paper, contributes to the understanding of material selection implications in the cradle-to-gate stage for the reduction of carbon emissions in mid-rise housing, in the context of Sri Lanka.

J	Leite, JPSP; Voskuijl, M				Pinto Leite, Jose Pedro Soares; Voskuijl, Mark			Optimal energy management for hybrid-electric aircraft	AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Dynamic programming; Optimal control; Flight performance; Hybrid aircraft; Optimal energy management	CONCEPTUAL DESIGN; POWER; IMPLEMENTATION; SYNERGY; VEHICLE	Purpose In recent years, increased awareness on global warming effects led to a renewed interest in all kinds of green technologies. Among them, some attention has been devoted to hybrid-electric aircraft - aircraft where the propulsion system contains power systems driven by electricity and power systems driven by hydrocarbon-based fuel. Examples of these systems include electric motors and gas turbines, respectively. Despite the fact that several research groups have tried to design such aircraft, in a way, it can actually save fuel with respect to conventional designs, the results hardly approach the required fuel savings to justify a new design. One possible path to improve these designs is to optimize the onboard energy management, in other words, when to use fuel and when to use stored electricity during a mission. The purpose of this paper is to address the topic of energy management applied to hybrid-electric aircraft, including its relevance for the conceptual design of aircraft and present a practical example of optimal energy management. Design/methodology/approach To address this problem the dynamic programming (DP) method for optimal control problems was used and, together with an aircraft performance model, an optimal energy management was obtained for a given aircraft flying a given trajectory. Findings The results show how the energy onboard a hybrid fuel-battery aircraft can be optimally managed during the mission. The optimal results were compared with non-optimal result, and small differences were found. A large sensitivity of the results to the battery charging efficiency was also found. Originality/value The novelty of this work comes from the application of DP for energy management to a variable weight system which includes energy recovery via a propeller.

Legumes are the primary source of dietary proteins in many developing countries, where protein hunger and malnutrition are widespread. Grain legumes germplasm constitute similar to 15% of the 7.4 M accessions preserved globally. Nearly, 78% of the CGIAR's, 0.217 M accessions, have been characterized, compared to 34% of national genebank collections. Interestingly, limited data on grain quality are available as the primary focus has been on morpho-agronomic traits. Clearly, more resources should be targeted on biochemical evaluation to identify nutritionally rich and genetically diverse germplasm. The formation of core and mini core collections has provided crop breeders with a systematic yet manageable entry point into global germplasm resources. These subsets have been reported for most legumes and have proved useful in identifying new sources of variation. They may however not eliminate the need to evaluate entire collections, particularly for very rare traits. Molecular characterization and association mapping will further aid to insights into the structure of legume diversity and facilitate greater use of collections. The use of high resolution elevational climate models has greatly improved our capacity to characterize plant habitats and species' adaptive responses to stresses. Evidence suggests that there has been increased use of wild relatives as well as new resources resulting from mutagenesis to enhance the genetic base of legume cultigens.	[Upadhyaya, H.

The ability to forecast thelake water is a paramount decision-making and risk-reduction task, and this isrequired to retain the sustainability of the natural environment, and to reduce the risk tothe local and globalfood chain, recreationactivities, agriculture and ecosystems. In this study, we have designed and evaluated a new hybrid forecasting model, integrating the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), as a heuristic optimization tool, with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP-GSA) algorithm to forecast water level in Winnipesaukee and Cypress Lakes in the United States of America. The performance of the resulting hybrid MLP-GSA model is benchmarked and compared with the traditional MLP trained with Levenberg-Marquadt back propagation learning algorithm, two other intelligent hybrid models (MLP-PSO and MLP-FFA) and also two stochastic models namely, ARMA and ARIMA models. In this case study, the monthly time scale water level data from 1938 to 2005 and 1942 to 2011 for the Lakes Winnipesaukee and Cypress, respectively, were applied to train and evaluate the MLP-GSA model. The best input combinations of the standalone (MLP) and the hybrid MLP-GSA forecasting models were determined by sensitivity analysis of historical water level training data for 1-month lead forecasting. The hybrid MLP-GSA model was evaluated independently with statistical score metrics: coefficient of correlation, coefficient of efficiency, the root mean square and relative root mean square errors, and the Bayesian Information Criterion. The results showed that the hybrid MLP-GSA4 and MLP-GSA5 model (where the 4 and 5months' of lagged input combinations of Lake water level data were utilized as the model inputs) performed more accurately than the ARIMA, ARMA, MLP4, MLP-PSO4 and MLP-FFA4 models for the Cypress Lake and ARIMA, ARMA, MLP5, MLP-PSO5 and MLP-FFA5 models for the Winnipesaukee lake, respectively. This study ascertained the robustness of hybrid MLP-GSA over ARMA, ARIMA, MLP, MLP-PSO and MLP-FFA for the forecasting of Lake water level. The high efficacy of the hybrid MLP-GSA model over theother applied models, indicate significant implications of its use in water resources management, decision-makingtasks, irrigation management,management ofhydrologic structures and sustainable use of water for agriculture andother necessities.

Yield stability across environments is a critical breeding goal when dealing with unstable climate and input reductions in farming systems. The objective of this study was to determine climatic and genetic factors contributing to genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype x environment (GE) variability for maize (Zea mays L) grain-yield under some stress conditions like drought, cold, and pest attack. A large sample of panilsh maize. populations was evaluated along with checks at three diverse locations during 3 yr. Factorial regression was performed to obtain a biological explanation of the G, E, and GE interaction for yield. The commercial hybrids had more yield and stability than most populations; therefore, breeding programs focusing on yield have released hybrids with high yield and stability under stress conditions. The populations with a reasonable compromise between yield and stability were Andoain and Lira. The main genotypic covariate was kernel depth followed by ear length, although other covariates were important for each location. The main climatic covariates for yield were related to days with mean temperature over 15 degrees C and maximum temperature in September, but they were not consistent across locations. Therefore, if yield under stress conditions is a breeding goal, several climatic variables, especially those related to high temperatures, and genotypic traits such as kernel depth and ear length should be considered.

Effect of morpho-physiological traits on grain yield of sorghum grown under stress at different growth stages, and stability analysis	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article							WATER-LIMITED CONDITIONS; STAY GREEN TRAIT; BICOLOR L MOENCH; OSMOTIC ADJUSTMENT; DROUGHT RESISTANCE; GENETIC-IMPROVEMENT; USE EFFICIENCY; PARAMETERS; GENOTYPES	Recent trends in climate change resulting in global warming and extreme dry spells during rainy seasons are having a negative impact on grain and fodder production in rain-fed crops in India. Understanding the mechanisms of drought tolerance at various growth stages will help in developing tolerant genotypes. Crosses were made between elite and drought-tolerant sorghums, and F-2 and F-3 progenies were evaluated for drought tolerance in multiple locations. Twenty-five F-4/F-5 derivatives along with drought-tolerant check plants (two high-yielding genotypes showing moderate drought tolerance: C43 (male parent of the commercial hybrid CSH 16, tolerant to drought) and CSV 17, (a pure line commercial cultivar released for drought-prone areas) were screened for drought tolerance under a factorial randomized block design with three replications during the rain-free months of April-June in 2007 and 2008 at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Kovilpatti, India. In each generation/year, four trials were conducted and water stress at different phases of crop growth, viz. vegetative, flowering and post-flowering (maturity), was imposed by withholding irrigation. Observations were recorded on grain and straw yields, plant height, number of roots, root length, leaf relative water content (LRWC), chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance under all treatments. The traits, grain yield, plant height, average root length and stomatal conductance showed significant mean sums of squares (SSs) for genotypexenvironment (GxE), suggesting that genotypes had significant differential response to the changing environments. Significant mean SSs due to GxE (linear) were obtained for straw yield, LRWC and chlorophyll content, indicating that the variability is partly genetic and partly influenced by environment. Grain yield was correlated with chlorophyll content (r=0.43) at the vegetative stage, with number of roots (r=0.49), LRWC (r=0.51), chlorophyll content (r=0.46) and stomatal conductance (r=-0.51) at the pre-flowering stage, and with LRWC (r=0.50) and stomatal conductance (r=-0.40) at the post-flowering stage, under water stress. Partial least square (PLS) analysis showed that different traits were important for grain yield under water stress at different growth stages.

Effects of temperature increase on the epidemiology of three major vector-borne viruses	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Cicadulina mbila; Epidemiology; Peregrinus maidis; Maize streak virus; Maize stripe virus; Maize mosaic virus	MAIZE STRIPE DISEASE; MASCARENE SOURCE; STREAK DISEASE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOSAIC-VIRUS; CICADULINA; RESISTANCE; POPULATIONS; STABILITY; EMERGENCE	The epidemiologies of Maize streak virus (MSV), Maize stripe virus (MSpV), and Maize mosaic virus (MMV) were compared in La Reunion over a three year-period. Disease incidence caused by each virus was assessed, and the leaf and planthopper vector populations (Cicadulina mbila and Peregrinus maidis) were estimated in weekly sowings of the temperate, virus-susceptible maize hybrid INRA 508 and of the composite resistant cv. IRAT 297. MSV caused the most prevalent disease and MMV the least, with lower incidences in cv. IRAT 297 than in INRA 508. For each plant-virus-vector combination, (a) disease incidence was positively correlated to vector abundance, often with 1 month of time lag; (b) annual periodicity of disease incidence and of vector numbers was consistent with highest autocorrelations and a time lag of 12 months, (c) vector numbers and disease incidence were closely associated with temperature fluctuations, both remaining relatively constant below 24 C and increasing rapidly above this threshold temperature. By contrast, relationships with rainfall and relative humidity (RH) were less consistent. Overall, 63 to 80% of the variance of disease incidence was explained through stepwise regression with vector number, temperature, and sometimes also rainfall or RH. The simple epidemiological model proposed underlines the close link between increased temperature and possible (re-) emergence of these three diseases in a maize cropping area.

The extent to which ecologically divergent selection acts to maintain species boundaries in the presence of hybridisation and gene flow is not well understood. Two parapatric taxa, Carbula humerigera (Uhler) and Carbula putoni (Jakovlev), were used to test the extent to which niche differentiation might sustain divergence of related taxa despite ongoing gene flow. 2. Mitochondrial [cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) and cytochrome b (Cytb)] and nuclear [elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1)] markers were sequenced from 383 individuals. Clusters of morphological variations were estimated and visualised using principal component analysis (PCA). Haplotype networks were constructed using median-joining and neighbour-net algorithm methods. Gene flows were estimated using migrate-n analyses. Suitable habitats for each species and their sympatric distribution were predicted with ecological niche modelling (ENM). Niche comparisons were conducted using Schoener's D and Warren's I. In addition, PCA, multivariate analysis of variance (manova) and discriminant function analysis were used to test ecological differentiation. 3. Morphological clusters and network analysis indicated that samples were generally divided into three groups (C. humerigera, C. putoni and hybrids). Ongoing gene flow was detected among the three groups, with abundant magnitudes in the sympatric region. Niche comparison and statistical analysis showed ecological differentiation between C. humerigera and C. putoni. Two potential hybrid zones were predicted in the ENM reconstruction, located along the Yanshan-Taihang-Qinling and Taishan mountains. 4. These results reveal a geographically delineated hybrid zone between C. humerigera and C. putoni. These two closely related Carbula species still live in different ecological niches despite hybridisation and ongoing gene flow.

Consequently, as droughts are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer due to climate change, there has been an increasing demand for EWT. However, when applied on a large scale to geographically dispersed rural populations, EWT requires the use of a significant vehicle fleet, leading to higher operational costs. It thus becomes crucial to propose solutions that guarantee EWT's financial and technical viability. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step procedure to address the problem of large-scale water distribution to drought-affected populations. In step one, we use the transportation problem to assign a set of demand points to water sources, and, in step two, we model the problem as Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems. Moreover, we also explore in this paper possibilities of using a new hybridizing Ant Colony Optimization metaheuristic with Random Variable Neighborhood Descent (MACS-RVND) to search for efficient solutions, in terms of the total distance and number of vehicles used, for large scale EWT. Hence, in the second step of the developed procedure, results from the MACS-RVND are compared with those obtained by Clarke and Wright heuristics with 2-opt, and with results from an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search approach proposed by Erdogan. The procedure was then applied to a real water distribution case in the Brazilian semi-arid region. Results are compared with the actual procedures adopted in Brazilian water distribution, showing that the developed procedure can promote more efficient, economic, and equitable water distribution.

The three treatments tested were beds of cabbage mulched with: (1) barley straw, (2) hay, and (3) black polyethylene (PE) sheeting. Bare-soil (un-mulched) beds were used as the control treatment. One early and one late experiment were performed in both years. In the early experiments, the mulches were applied at the start of the experiment, whereas in the late experiments the soil was first covered with black polyethylene for approximately 1 month. In both years, the springs were cold and wet, and so the thrips appeared late and their numbers were low. The highest mean actual weight and trimmed weight were recorded for cabbage grown in 2005 under PE mulch (actual early: 995g, actual late: 1184 g, trimmed early: 870g, trimmed late: 1056 g). Year 2004 gave lower values (110g for both variables) under barley straw and hay mulch (165g and 160g, respectively). There was no evidence of an allelopathic effect of water extracts of either barley straw or hay.

The National Genebank (NGB) at ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi, acts as a repository of PGRs for future use. This study aimed at screening for the adventitious presence of transgenes in brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) accessions conserved in the NGB. The study targeted the collections made during 2007-2016 from areas adjacent to Bangladesh (Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Tripura and West Bengal), where field trials of Bt brinjal event EE1 were conducted during 2005-2012 and commercial cultivation of this event was permitted in 2013.There could be an apprehension of both unintentional introgression and transboundary movement through borders. Adventitious presence of transgenes was checked in a set of 96 accessions of brinjal employing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR assays. As event EE1 carries crylAc gene for insect resistance with Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (CaMV) promoter (P-35S) and marker genes (nptII and aadA), so these genetic elements were targeted for qualitative GM testing. Based on the test results, transgenes were not detected in brinjal accessions conserved in NGB. Our study showed that brinjal and wild species collected from adjoining areas of Bangladesh, post field trials and release, do not contain the event EE1. The study presents an efficient and reliable method to ensure conservation of GM-free gennplasm in the NGB.

The resulting demographic fluctuations linked to the available patches of vegetation should have been prone to bottlenecks and founder events, affecting the fate of gene pool dynamics. However, these events also promoted the diversification of cacti, creating an ecological opportunity for host specialization. We tested the hypothesis of ecological speciation in the Drosophila buzzatii group. We assessed adaptive footprints and examined the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits in the sibling allopatric species D. koepferae and D. antonietae. The results are in line with the idea that these species evolved under different ecological scenarios. Joint-scaling analysis comparing both species and their hybrids revealed that additive genetic variance was the major contributor to phenotypic divergence, but dominance, epistasis and maternal effects were also important factors. Correlation analysis among functionally related traits suggested divergent selection on phenotypic integration associated with fitness. These findings support the hypothesis of adaptive evolution driving the phylogenetic radiation of the group through independent events of host shifts to chemically complex columnar cacti.

A major challenge for biological invasion research is to develop the ability to predict the spread of species. Throughout the world, Ludwigia peploides subsp. montevidensis and Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala are now considered to be two of the most invasive aquatic plants. This paper reviews the scientific knowledge about these species, their ecological and socio-economic impacts and methods of management. Water primrose possesses some advantageous biological traits, such as rapid growth rate, efficient reproductive capacity, high plasticity in growth response, broad ecological tolerance and allelopathic compounds which might explain its expansion and colonization of numerous ecosystems. Much attention must be paid to Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala and Ludwigia peploides subsp. montevidensis. According to climatic models, global warming will further increase the spread of these species in Europe. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Morpho-physiological evaluation of tomato genotypes under high temperature stress conditions	JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE			English	Article						diversity; characterization; heat stress; tomato; physiological; growth	HEAT TOLERANCE; WATER RELATIONS; PHOTOSYSTEM-II; GAS-EXCHANGE; PHOTOINHIBITION; PLANTS; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ACCLIMATION; INHIBITION; CULTIVARS	BACKGROUND: Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is an important but heat-sensitive vegetable crop. The losses in tomato production associated with heat stress are aggravating further under a global warming scenario. The present study was designed to investigate the comparative performance of tomato genotypes under high temperature stress. Tomato genotypes (191) were exposed to the controlled conditions of high temperature (40/32 degrees C day/night temperature). Different morphological (shoot length, root length, shoot fresh weight, root fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root dry weight and number of leaves), physiological (photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, water use efficiency, stomatal conductance to water, sub-stomatal CO2 and leaf temperature) and SPAD value (chlorophyll content) were recorded to check the diversity among genotypes against heat stress. RESULTS: All the genotypes showed a significantly variable response in almost all the attributes under high-temperature conditions. Correlation among the variables provided a clear understanding of the phenomena involved. Based on all the attributes studied, genotypes L00090 and L00091 were found to be the most heat tolerant compared to other genotypes, whereas CLN1462A and CLN 1466E were found to be comparatively sensitive. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the studied attributes were genotype dependent, and significant diverse performance was noted. The findings of this study pave the way towards the selection of tolerant genotypes, not only for use under high-temperature conditions but also to employ them in breeding programs to produce heat-tolerant hybrids.

J	Tan, YY; Deng, L; Li, LX; Yuan, F				Tan, Yuyang; Deng, Lei; Li, Longxiao; Yuan, Fang			The capacitated pollution routing problem with pickup and delivery in the last mile	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS			English	Article						Home delivery and pickup site services; Hybrid two-phase algorithm; Pollution-routing problem	FUEL CONSUMPTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH; MODEL	Purpose With the increasing awareness of global warming and the important role of last mile distribution in logistics activities, the purpose of this paper is to build an environmental and effective last mile distribution model considering fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission, vehicle capacity and two practical delivery service options: home delivery (HD) and pickup site service (PS). This paper calls the problem as the capacitated pollution-routing problem with pickup and delivery (CPRPPD). The goal is to find an optimal route to minimize operational and environmental costs, as well as a set of optimal speeds over each arc, while respecting capacity constraints of vehicles and pickup sites. Design/methodology/approach To solve this problem, this research proposes a two-phase heuristic algorithm by combining a hybrid ant colony optimization (HACO) in the first stage and a multiple population genetic algorithm in the second stage. First, the HACO is presented to find the minimal route solution and reduce distribution cost based on optimizing the speed over each arc. Findings To verify the proposed CPRPPD model and algorithm, a real-world instance is conducted. Comparing with the scenario including HD service only, the scenario including both HD and PS option is more economical, which indicates that the CPRPPD model is more efficient. Besides, the results of speed optimization are significantly better than before. Practical implications - The developed CPRPPD model not only minimizes delivery time and reduces the total emission cost, but also helps logistics enterprises to establish a more complete distribution system and increases customer satisfaction. The model and algorithm of this paper provide optimal support for the actual distribution activities of logistics enterprises in low-carbon environment, and also provide reference for the government to formulate energy-saving and emission reduction policies. Originality/value This paper provides a great space for the improvement of carbon emissions in the last mile distribution. The results show that the distribution arrangement including HD and PS services in the last mile adopting speed optimization can significantly reduce the carbon emission. Additionally, an integrated real-world instance is applied in this paper to illustrate the validity of the model and the effectiveness of this method.

Due to its increasing importance in view of climate change, predicting groundwater level (GWL) needs to be improved to enhance management. We used adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) to predict the GWL of the Urmia aquifer in northwestern Iran under various input scenarios using precipitation, temperature, groundwater withdrawal, GWL during the previous month, and river flow. In total, 11 input patterns from various combinations of variables were developed. About 70% of the data were used to train the models, while the rest were used for validation. In a second step, several metaheuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACOR), and differential evolution (DE) were used to improve the model and, consequently, prediction performance. The results showed that (i) RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.51 m, 0.00037 m, and 0.86, respectively, were obtained for the ANFIS model using all input variables, indicating a rather poor performance, (ii) metaheuristic algorithms were able to optimize the parameters of the ANFIS model in predicting GWL, (iii) the input pattern that included all input variables resulted in the most appropriate performance with RMSE, MAPE, and NSE of 0.28 m, 0.00019 m, and 0.97, respectively, using the ANIFS-ACOR hybrid model, (iv) results of Taylor's diagram (CC = 0.98, STD = 0.2, and RMSD = 0.30), as well as the scatterplot (R-2 = 0.97), showed that best prediction was achieved by ANFIS-ACOR, and (v) temperature and evaporation exerted stronger influence on GWL prediction than groundwater withdrawal and precipitation. The findings of this study reveal that metaheuristic algorithms can significantly improve the performance of the ANFIS model in predicting GWL.

Given the heterogeneity of the environment, and indications of local adaptation, there are many unknowns regarding the response of these forests to future outbreaks. To better understand this we aim to identify genetic regions that have adaptive potential. We used data collected on 472 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci from 576 tree samples collected across 13 lodgepole pine-dominated sites and four jack pine-dominated sites. We looked at the relationship of genetic diversity with the environment, and we identified candidate loci using both frequency-based (ARLEQUIN and BAYESCAN) and correlation-based (MATSAM and BAYENV) methods. We found contrasting relationships between environmental variation and genetic diversity for the species. While we identified a number of candidate outliers (34 in lodgepole pine, 25 in jack pine, and 43 interspecific loci), we did not find any loci in common between lodgepole and jack pine. Many of the outlier loci identified were correlated with environmental variation. Using rigorous criteria we have been able to identify potential outlier SNPs. We have also found evidence of contrasting environmental adaptations between lodgepole and jack pine which could have implications for beetle spread risk.	[Cullingham, Catherine I.; Cooke, Janice E.

Gaertn.), birches (Betula pendula Roth. and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), elms (Ulmus glabra Huds., Ulmus laevis Pall. and Ulmus minor Mill.), limes (Tilia cordata Mill. and Tilia platyphyllos Scop.), maples (Acer campestre L., Acer platanoides L. and Acer pseudoplatanus L.), wild service tree (Sorbus domestica L. and Sorbus torminalis L. Crantz), walnuts (Juglans regia L., Juglans nigra L. and hybrids) and wild cherry (Prunus avium L.) are important components of European forests. Many species have high economic, environmental and social values. Their scattered distributions, exacerbated in many cases by human activity, may make them more vulnerable to climate change. They are likely to have less ability to reproduce or adapt to shifting climate space than more widespread species. The general impacts of climate change on these scattered species are reviewed. Some specific risks and opportunities are highlighted for each species, although there is considerable uncertainty and therefore, difficulty in quantifying many specific risks and/or impacts on scattered broadleaved tree species.

Fitness variation across a subspecies border	EVOLUTION			English	Article						fitness components; local adaptation; range boundary; range expansion; range versus regional adaptation; reciprocal transplant	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; HYBRID ZONE; NATURAL-SELECTION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; SELF-POLLINATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RANGE LIMITS; POPULATIONS; PHLOX; DIFFERENTIATION	Because the range boundary is the locale beyond which a taxon fails to persist, it provides a unique opportunity for studying the limits on adaptive evolution. Adaptive constraints on range expansion are perplexing in view of widespread ecotypic differentiation by habitat and region within a species' range (regional adaptation) and rapid evolutionary response to novel environments. In this Study of two parapatric subspecies, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. x. ssp. parviflora, we compared the fitness of population transplants within their native region, in a non-native region within the native range, and in the non-native range to assess whether range expansion might be limited by a greater intensity of selection on colonists of a new range versus a new region within the range. The combined range of the two subspecies spans a west-to-east gradient of declining precipitation in the Sierra Nevada of California, with ssp. xantiana in the west being replaced by ssp. parviflora in the east. Both Subspecies had significantly higher fitness in the native range (range adaptation), whereas regional adaptation was weak and was found only in the predominantly outcrossing ssp. xantiana but was absent in the inbreeding ssp. parviflora. Because selection intensity on transplants was Much stronger in the non-native range relative to non-native regions, there is a larger adaptive barrier to range versus regional expansion. Three of five sequential fitness components accounted for regional and range adaptation, but only one of them, survivorship from germination to flowering, contributed to both. Flower number contributed to regional adaptation in ssp. xantiana and fruit Set (number of fruits per flower) to range adaptation. Differential survivorship of the two taxa or regional Populations of ssp. xantiana in non-native environments was attributable. in part, to biotic interactions, including competition, herbivory, and pollination. For example. low fruit set in ssp. xantiana in the east was likely due to the absence of its principal specialist bee pollinators in ssp. parviflora's range. Thus, convergence on self-fertilization may be necessary for ssp. xantiana to invade ssp. parviflora's range. but the evolution of outcrossing would not be required for ssp. parviflora to invade ssp. xantiana's range.

The availability of adequate renewable energy is in demand. Jatropha is being explored as a potential biofuel crop candidate because of its biodiesel production potential, high oil content, rapid growth, easy propagation, drought tolerant nature, relatively less irrigation and agricultural inputs, insect and pest resistance. However, previous programmes for Jatropha plantation did not satisfy the expectation because of the absence of a good commercial variety, large scale propagation without evaluating the planting material, knowledge gap and consideration as low a impute crop. Lack of systematic breeding programmes, the inexistence of a collaboration between scientists in this field, the unavailability of desired germplasm and more importantly less variability within the species are the constraints for the conventional breeding for a Jatropha improvement programme. Biological techniques have proven records for the improvement of many crops. Jatropha "organogenesis", which has insignificant contribution to genetic improvement, is studied. Several genomic and transgenic studies have been reported, but it is still far behind in comparison to other crops. It is time to investigate somaclonal variation, in vitro selection and haploid breeding for Jatropha improvement Resequencing and transcriptom analysis are necessary for high dance linkage map and a good reference genome. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) are pending. Genetic engineering, particularly to increase female flowers in inflorescence, eliminates the toxic component and increases tolerance to diseases, insects and pests should be given priority.

J	Saqib, M; Anjum, MA				Saqib, Muhammad; Anjum, Muhammad Akbar			MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECT IN SWEET PEPPER (Capsicum annuum L.) THROUGH ADJUSTMENT OF PLANTING TIME	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Capsicum annuum; growth attributes; leaf area index; planting dates; sweet pepper cultivars; yield attributes	BELL PEPPER; YIELD; PHENOLOGY; GROWTH; MAIZE; DATES; CROP	Sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is one of the most popular and high value vegetable crops grown for its immature fruits throughout the world. In Pakistan it is cultivated as warm season crop in open fields during summer and in plastic tunnels during winter. Optimum planting date in sweet pepper production is key to better yield as it determines the period of maximum crop potential, efficient use of resources, lesser competition of plants with weeds and insect pests. It is the need of time to understand the negative impact of climate change on phenological development of sweet pepper. Therefore, the current study was designed to mitigate the effect of climate on growth and yield of sweet pepper cultivars at agro-ecological area of Multan, Pakistan by adjusting planting date. Three transplanting dates (viz. February 15th, March 2nd and March 16th) were evaluated during year 1 whereas five transplanting dates (viz. February 1st, February 15th, March 2nd, March 16th and April 1st) were assessed during year 2. There were three sweet pepper cultivars (Ganga, Winner and Savio) under study. Overall plant growth (stem height, average canopy diameter, number of leaves per plant and fresh and dry mass of plant parts) was significantly higher in the earliest planting dates (viz. February 15th in year 1 and February 1st in year 2) and it reduced as the planting was delayed. Plant yield, number of fruits and average fruit weight were also significantly greater in the earliest planting dates, and significantly lesser in later planting dates. During year 1, the effect of cultivar was prominent, and Winner performed better regarding growth characteristics while the effect was non-significant on yield attributes except average fruit weight which was also significantly higher in Winner as compared with other two cultivars. During year 2, cv. Winner performed better in growth attributes, whereas significantly greater number of fruits was found in cv. Savio, average fruit diameter was greater in cv. Winner and average fruit length was higher in cv. Ganga. It is concluded that nursery of sweet pepper should be planted in 1st week of February to achieve maximum growth and yield of fruits. In cultivar selection, cv. Winner should be preferred among sweet pepper hybrids.

J	Clement, G; Louvel, D				Clement, Guy; Louvel, Didier			Rice varietal improvement for Mediterranean France	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES			French	Article						France; irrigated rice; Oryza sativa; plant breeding; plant certification		In France, rice is grown mainly near the Mediterranean Sea, in the Camargue. An irrigated system based on direct seeding on wet land is used. Occurrence of cold periods throughout the crop cycle (April/May-September/October) and the risk of soil salinization are the most important constraints. Since 1988, CIRAD and CFR have been implementing a rice breeding program for the Camargue. It aims at creating cultivars fitting the needs of rice farmers (yield potential and stability), the rice industry (milling and processing qualities) and consumers (cooking and taste qualities). Varieties grown in the region belong to the japonica subspecies of Oryza sativa. Hybridization is the basis for creation of variability. Progenies are selected using the pedigree method associated or not with haploidipolidisation applied to the first generation. Marker-assisted selection has recently been introduced to improve selection efficacy for resistance to fungal diseases occurring erratically in relation to climate. So far, 25 varieties have been registered in the European Official Catalogue, of which 5 have proven particularly successful among farmers. Progress achieved for germination in anaerobic conditions, resistance to stem borers, grain shape and other qualities, including aroma, are presented. Prospects in relation to new objectives such as weed control and adaptation to climate change are also presented.

J	Griebel, J; Utz, M; Hermisson, J; Wolinska, J				Griebel, Johanna; Utz, Margarete; Hermisson, Joachim; Wolinska, Justyna			The establishment of hybrids of the Daphnia longispina complex explained by a mathematical model incorporating different overwintering life history strategies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SPECIES COMPLEX; TRANSGRESSIVE SEGREGATION; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; SEXUAL REPRODUCTION; GENE FLOW; HYBRIDIZATION; DYNAMICS; COMMUNITIES; POPULATIONS; ADAPTATION	Interspecific hybridization (i.e. mating between species) occurs frequently in animals. Among cyclical parthenogens, hybrids can proliferate and establish through parthenogenetic reproduction, even if their sexual reproduction is impaired. In water fleas of the Daphnia longispina species complex, interspecific hybrids hatch from sexually produced dormant eggs. However, fewer hybrid genotypes contribute to the dormant egg bank and their hatching rate from dormant eggs is reduced, compared to eggs resulting from intraspecific crosses. Therefore, Daphnia hybrids would benefit from adaptations that increase their survival over winter as parthenogenetic lineages, avoiding the need to re-establish populations after winter from sexually produced dormant eggs. Here, we constructed a mathematical model to examine the conditions that could explain the frequently observed establishment of hybrids in the D. longispina species complex. Specifically, we compared the outcome of hybrid and parental taxa competition given a reduced contribution of hybrids to hatchlings from the sexually produced dormant egg bank, but their increased ability to survive winter as parthenogenetic lineages. In addition, different growth rates of parental species and differences in average annual temperatures were evaluated for their influence on hybrid production and establishment. Our model shows that increased overwinter performance as parthenogenetic females can compensate for reduced success in sexual reproduction, across all tested scenarios for varying relative growth rates of parental species. This pattern holds true for lower annual temperatures, but at higher temperatures hybrids were less successful. Consequently, hybrids might become less abundant as temperatures rise due to climate change, resulting in reduced diversity and faster differentiation of the parental species.

Characterizing multiple linkages between individual diseases, crop health syndromes, germplasm deployment, and rice production situations in India	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						Crop health syndrome; Production situation; Deployment of germplasm; Discriminant analysis; Correspondence analysis; Ustilaginoidea virens; Rice diseases; Rice insects; Emerging diseases; Climate change; Global change	PLANT-DISEASE; YIELD LOSSES; QUANTIFICATION; PESTS	Five groups of crop health syndromes, four production situations, and three patterns of germplasm deployment were identified and characterized from a data set consisting of information from 129 Indian districts, which were surveyed in 2005 as part of the Production-Oriented Surveys conducted by the Directorate of Rice Research of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. ANOVAs and MANOVAs indicated that these groupings from hierarchical cluster analyses correspond to clearly different levels of disease and animal pest injuries (crop health syndromes): of crop rotation, crop management, agricultural resources, and inputs (production situations): and of deployment of traditional, high yielding, or hybrid plant material (patterns of germplasm deployment). Correspondence analysis and discriminant analyses further indicated that crop health syndromes, and their change, are strongly associated with production situations, and patterns of germplasm deployment. A few specific hypotheses were tested, indicating that false smut is statistically associated with the involvement of hybrid rice in patterns of germplasm deployment. This highlights the need for research on the biology and the epidemiology of this disease in order to develop suitable management tools. Importantly, this work shows that national surveys, such as the Production-Oriented Surveys conducted by the Directorate of Rice Research, generate extremely valuable information to guide research and development through the characterization of production environments, contexts, and crop health responses, in times of unprecedented agricultural change. This work concurs with earlier results obtained at the field level, and thus opens important methodological questions regarding the up- and down-scaling of information between different scales (e.g., field, district). We propose that our ability to predict emerging diseases and crop health syndromes in the face of global and climate change will necessarily entail our ability to link different scales, where a range of different processes, biological and socio-economic, take place.

To overcome this problem, the current study was designed to evaluate heat stress induced responses in maize hybrids for morpho-physiological and kernel quality related traits. The research was conducted at Maize and Millets Research Institute (MMRI), Yusafwala, Pakistan for three consecutive spring seasons (2017, 2018 and 2019). Maize hybrids were sown under two heat regimes: (i) normal sowing and (ii) sowing under heat stress (late sowing) for each spring seasons. Results revealed highly significant (P<0.05) differences among maize hybrids for kernel yield and related traits under both conditions and for all three seasons. Moreover, 11% to 36% reduction in kernel yield was observed during heat stress compared to normal sowing. Highest average percentage reduction was observed in local hybrid YH-5532 (28.7%) followed by all the three multinational hybrids NK-8711 (27.3%), P-1543 (23.4%) and DK-6724 (21.2%), respectively. This reduction in kernel yield was attributed to the reduction in thousand kernel weight (4.8% to17.2%), number of kernels per ear (4.7% to 13.3%), net photosynthetic rate (11% to 24.9%) and shelling percentage (up to 4.7%) as revealed by biplot analysis. Biplot analysis further unveiled that two local maize hybrids YH-5507 and YH-5427 were the most productive and heat tolerant hybrids under both conditions and for three consecutive seasons. Therefore, these hybrids are recommended general cultivation especially in heat prone areas.

It is unclear whether this was a new phenomenon, which species were involved, and whether these mosquitoes had established themselves in the local circumstances. Methods: The present study was undertaken in six urban sites of Chengguan district Lhasa city, Tibet. Adult mosquitoes were collected by bed net trap, labor hour method and light trap in August 2009 and August 2012. The trapped adult mosquitoes were initially counted and identified according to morphological criteria, and a proportion of mosquitoes were examined more closely using a multiplex PCR assay. Results: 907 mosquitoes of the Culex pipiens complex were collected in this study. Among them, 595 were females and 312 were males. There was no significant difference in mosquito density monitored by bed net trap and labor hour method in 2009 and 2012. Of 105 mosquitoes identified by multiplex PCR, 36 were pure mosquitoes (34.29%) while 69 were hybrids (65.71%). The same subspecies of Culex pipiens complex were observed by bed net trap, labor hour method and light trap in 2009 and 2012. Conclusion: The local Culex pipiens complex comprises the subspecies Cx. pipiens pipiens, Cx. pipiens pallens, Cx. pipiens quinquefasciatus and its hybrids. Mosquitoes in the Cx. pipiens complex, known to be, potentially, vectors of periodic filariasis and encephalitis, are now present from one season to the next, and appear to be established in Lhasa City, TAR.

Increased root herbivory under elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations is reversed by silicon-based plant defences	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						atmospheric concentrations of CO2; below-ground herbivory; climate change; crop damage; insect herbivore; pest management; plant defences; silicon; sugar cane	WATER AVAILABILITY; CO2; RESISTANCE; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; METABOLISM; AUSTRALIA; CHEMISTRY; RESPONSES; PRESSURE	1. Predicted increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 may alter the susceptibility of many plants to insect herbivores due to changes in plant nutrition and defences. Silicon plays a critical role in plant defence against herbivores, so increasing such silicon-based defences in plants may help remediate situations where plants become more susceptible to herbivores. 2. Sugar cane (Saccharum spp. hybrid) was subjected to fully factorial treatment combinations of ambient (aCO(2)) or elevated (eCO(2)) atmospheric CO2 concentrations; ambient silicon or silicon supplementation; insect-free or subject to root herbivory by greyback canegrub (Dermolepida albohirtum). A glasshouse study was used to determine how these factors affected rates of photosynthesis, growth, chemistry (concentrations of silicon, carbon, nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates). Changes in canegrub mass were determined in the glasshouse pot study, together with more detailed assessment of how eCO(2) and silicon supplementation affected performance and feeding behaviour (relative growth rate and relative consumption) in a 24-h feeding efficiency assay. 3. Elevated CO2 and silicon supplementation increased rates of photosynthesis (+32% and 14%, respectively) and sugar cane biomass (+45% and 69%, respectively). Silicon supplementation increased silicon concentrations in both leaves and roots by 54% and 75%, respectively. eCO(2) caused root C:N to increase by 12%. 4. Canegrub performance and consumption increased under eCO(2); relative growth rate (RGR) increased by 116% and consumed 57% more root material (suggestive of compensatory feeding). Silicon application reversed these effects, with large decreases in mass change, RGR and root consumption (65% less root mass consumed). 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest future atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations could lead to increased crop damage by a below-ground herbivore. Increasing bioavailable silicon in soil stimulated silicon-based defences which dramatically decreased herbivory and herbivore performance. Our findings suggest future pest management strategies could benefit from characterising deficiencies in bioavailable silicon in agricultural soils and targeted application of silicon fertilisers. Moreover, future breeding programmes should exploit variation in silicon uptake between cultivars to enhance silicon uptake in new crop varieties. Silicon-based plant defence proved to be highly beneficial for remediating the negative effects of atmospheric change on sugar cane susceptibility to herbivory and could be applicable in other crops.

The environmental conditions are expected to further aggravate crop production in the future as a result of continuous greenhouse gas emissions, causing further temperature rise and leading to increased evapotranspiration, severe drought, soil salinity, as well as insect and disease threats. These suboptimal growth conditions have negative impact on plant growth, survival, and crop yield. Potato is well known as a crop extremely susceptible to drought, which is primarily attributed to its shallow root system. With potato being the fourth major food crop, increasing potato productivity is thus important for food security and for feeding global population. To maintain a sustainable potato production, it is necessary to develop stress tolerant potato cultivars that cope with the already ongoing climate change. The aim of our study is to analyze the response of potato somatic hybrids to drought and salt stress under in vitro conditions; the somatic hybrids studied are the wild relative Solanum chacoense (+) Solanum tuberosum, with or without mismatch repair deficiency (MMR). Upon this selection of drought and salt tolerant genotypes, somatic hybrids and their parents were phenotyped on a semi-automated platform, and lines tolerant to medium water scarcity (20% compared to 60% soil water capacity) were identified. Although none of the parental species were tolerant to drought, some of the MMR-deficient somatic hybrids showed tolerance to drought and salt as a new trait.

Phylogeographic structure without pre-mating barriers: Do habitat fragmentation and low mobility preserve song and chorus diversity in a European bushcricket?

One prediction is that phenotypic differences among populations serve as pre-mating barriers should secondary contact occur. Post-mating barriers may also function and ensure further separation of the populations. We tested these predictions in an acoustic insect, the European bushcricket Ephippiger diurnus, that is geographically distributed in separated, genetically isolated populations distinguished by pronounced differences in male songs and chorusing and female preferences for song. We staged mixed-population choruses to examine how males sing when in the company of other populations, and we released females in these choruses to assess their preference for or aversion toward males of their own population versus a different one. We also paired males and females of the same and different populations to test mating success, spermatophore transfer, and oviposition in the various pairings. In most cases males sang as effectively when accompanied by males from another population as when in a single-population chorus, and females overall expressed little aversion toward males from a different population. Inter-population pairs did not mate less frequently, transfer smaller spermatophores, or deposit fewer or smaller eggs than pairs of males and females from the same population. We infer that pre-mating barriers play little role in maintaining phylogeographic structure despite the acoustic differences between populations. Rather, the structure probably reflects the fragmented distribution of suitable habitat and the low mobility of both juveniles and adults. Thus, if secondary contact does occur, and we predict that it will in several key locations owing to ongoing environmental change, coalescence of populations and reduction of genetic and acoustic diversity may follow.

In the present study, field and pot trials were carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Padova at Legnaro (NE Italy) in a silty-loam soil in order to investigate the effects of soil amendment with wood ash (0.1% w/w, incorporated into the 0.2-m top soil) on the bioavailability of mineral elements and their uptake by maize. Characteristics analyzed included plant growth, leaf transpiration dynamics, and productivity in two contrasting hybrids, P1921 (drought sensitive) and D24 (drought tolerant). Wood ash contained relevant amounts of Ca, K, Mg, P, and S, and hazardous levels of Zn (732 mg kg(-1)), Pb (527 mg kg(-1)), and Cu (129 mg kg(-1)), although no significant changes in total soil element concentration, pH, and electrical conductivity were detected in open field. Ash application led to a general increasing trend of diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid (DTPA)-extractable of various elements, bringing to higher grain P in D24 hybrid, and Zn and Ni reductions in P1921 hybrid. Here, the results demonstrated that ash amendment enhanced shoot growth and the number of leaves, causing a reduction of harvest index, without affecting grain yield in both hybrids. The most relevant result was a retarded inhibition of leaf transpiration under artificial progressive water stress, particularly in the drought-tolerant D24 hybrid that could be sustained by root growth improvements in the field across the whole 0-1.5 m soil profile in D24, and in the amended top soil in P1921. It is concluded that woody ash can be profitably exploited in maize fertilization for enhancing shoot and root growth and drought tolerance, thanks to morphological and physiological improvements, although major benefits are expected to be achieved in drought tolerant hybrids. Attention should be payed when using ash derived by metal contaminated wood stocks to avoid any health risk in food uses.

In this paper, an ultra-compact highly efficient miniaturized windmill comprising a hybridized nanogenerator (MW-HNG) is reported based on three conversion mechanisms i.e. triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG), and electromagnetic generator (EMG). The MW-HNG is designed as a 3D-printed fully-enclosed structure for the natural wind energy harvesting by converting into rotational motion: all harvesting units reside in a common rotation system to effectively and simultaneously produce electricity. At a wind speed of 6 m/s, the flexible-blade-based hybridization-mode (contact-lateral sliding-separation-contact) TENG and coupled PENG can generate maximal power values of 1.67 mW and 1.38 mW at optimal load resistances of 10 M Omega and 330 K Omega, respectively. In contrast, the multipole-magnet-based EMG can obtain a maximal output power of 268.6mW at 180 Omega. The MW-HNG demonstrates a quick charging ability for capacitors and the capability to feed hundreds of LEDs. Further, a self-powered wireless sensor system is developed for real-time environmental monitoring by combining an MW-HNG, a customized power management circuit, and wireless sensor unit (a smartphone to display sensor data). Our proposed MW-HNG is suitable for self-powered wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the subway system by generating high-power electrical output from moving-induced wind mechanical energy.

Using DNA sequence data from cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, we investigated the phylogeographical pattern among 10 endemic cockroach species within the genus Celatoblatta Johns (Blattidae). We tested the hypothesis that an ancestral cockroach species underwent rapid speciation in response to major climatic differentiation induced by mountain building. Results suggest that speciation was a twofold process, with an interspecific radiation of Pliocene/Pleistocene age followed by intraspecific diversification during the mid Pleistocene. Average genetic distance (maximum likelihood GTR + I + Gamma) was 9.17%, with a maximum of 14.5%. Data revealed eight deep well-supported branches, each with terminal clades. Six clades were differentiated according to morphological species, while the seventh was composed of three sympatric species. We consider the latter to be a phylogenetic species, possibly as a result of hybridization within a defined geographical area. This finding seriously challenges species distinctions for these three cockroach species. Correlation between genetic distances and a Climate Similarity Index (CSI) was negative, suggesting that species found in similar habitats are also genetically closely related. A Mantel test on within-clade genetic distances vs. linear geographical distance was positive, suggesting allopatric isolation for those haplotypes. We present a model of speciation for South Island Celatoblatta.

The commonly used plantation species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), interior spruce (a naturally occurring hybrid between Picea glauca and P. engelmannii) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), survived as well as, but grew more slowly than, western larch (Larix occidentalis), western white pine (Pinus monticola) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and faster than western redcedar (Thuja plicata). Site index values were generally higher than published values for similar sites. Numerous pests affected all species in the trials. Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) caused heavy mortality in lodgepole pine in part of one trial, and Armillaria root disease caused widespread damage to western larch and Douglas-fir in the other trial. Western white pine from local seed sources were severely damaged by white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) in both trials but a rust-resistant seed source used in one trial survived better. Frost damage reduced survival and growth of Douglas-fir in one trial and may have affected western white pine. Survival of two planted broadleaves (Betula papyrifera) and a hybrid of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and black poplar (Populus nigra) was severely reduced by drought. The results support ongoing efforts to broaden the number of species used in British Columbia reforestation programs.

We used ten nuclear microsatellite markers to quantify genetic variation within Fraser fir and intermediate fir, and to examine their evolutionary relationships with the widespread balsam fir (Abies balsamea [L.] Mill.). We found little genetic differentiation among these taxa, suggesting that Fraser fir might best be classified as a variety of balsam fir. The results further appear to reject the hypothesis that intermediate fir was of hybrid origin between two comparatively distantly related species. Low levels of genetic diversity suggest that intermediate fir and Fraser fir have undergone at least some genetic degradation since post-Pleistocene isolation. The results may prove important for in situ and ex situ gene conservation efforts for Fraser fir and intermediate fir, which are imperiled by an exotic insect and by global climate change.

Susceptibility to cold winter conditions has been recognized as the limiting factor in Europe for Tetranychus evansi, an invasive spider mite feeding on Solanaceous plants originated from tropical South America and now present on every continent except Australia. Two genetically distinct lineages of this species were introduced to Europe; one (lineage 1) is widely distributed, while the other (lineage 2) has a limited distribution. Whether this difference corresponds to differences in cold hardiness is evaluated here by assessing phenotypic response of T. evansi to the winter conditions that the mite encounters in the coldest parts of the current invaded area. We designed the thermal regimes to mimic winter conditions, including temperature fluctuations between day and night (L:D 8:16, 12:4 degrees C) and exposed mites to this regime for 5, 10 or 15 weeks. We tested T. evansi from three locations, one from the tropical native area (Piracicaba, Brazil) and two, corresponding to the two introduced lineages, from the temperate invaded area (lineage 1 from Nice and lineage 2 from Perpignan, France). After 5 weeks of treatment, mites from all the locations showed high survival rates but the two introduced populations grew, producing more than one offspring per female. After 10 weeks, survival rates declined for mites from Brazil and Perpignan, but not Nice. After 15 weeks, only the mites from Nice survived and produced offspring. Thus, mites belonging to the widespread lineage 1 exhibit increased cold tolerance suggesting broader adaptability, helping to explain its current geographical distribution.

J	Dvorak, W				Dvorak, Ws			The strategic importance of applied tree conservation programs to the forest industry in South Africa	SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE			English	Article						adaptability; ex situ conservation; climate change	EUCALYPTUS-UROPHYLLA; PINUS-PATULA; GENETIC DIVERSITY; PITCH CANKER; POPULATIONS; RESISTANCE; GENOME; GROWTH; PINES	Because of anticipated adverse climatic change and resulting increases in disease and insect attacks in forest plantations in the future, forest industries must maintain broad genetic bases for adaptability and pest resistance. Since the early 1980s, the South African forest industry has obtained genetic material of 25 pine and eucalypt species that represent more than 4 200 trees from 260 natural populations around the world through its participation in Camcore (International Tree Breeding and Conservation Program) at North Carolina State University, USA. This combined genetic testing and conservation program has identified new productive pine species, such as P. tecunumanii and P. maximinoi, that grow well and are resistant in the seedling stage to the pitch canker fungus (Fusarium circinatum). Because of the industry's foresight to assemble genetic material and test alternate species over the last three decades, it was well prepared to immediately develop more-resistant pine hybrids such as P. patula x P. tecunumanii when the pitch canker situation became problematic. The South African forest industry has collectively worked together to established special 20-40 ha conservation parks across the country to hold and protect the original genetic material collected in Central America, Mexico and South-east Asia. Species are conserved in the parks at the population level and are represented by a minimum of 10 open-pollinated families, five trees per family across two sites. The design is based on maintaining an effective population size of approximately 30 with the goal to capture alleles at high frequencies as well as to include a number of rare alleles in the ex situ plantings. The overlying goal is to maintain well-adapted genetic material for future deployment.

J	Delhey, K; Peters, A				Delhey, Kaspar; Peters, Anne			Conservation implications of anthropogenic impacts on visual communication and camouflage	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; color; crypsis; habitat degradation; light; pollution; urbanization; water turbidity	SEXUAL SELECTION; COLOR PATTERNS; AMBIENT LIGHT; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; LEK PLACEMENT; SENSORY DRIVE; PEPPERED MOTH; CICHLID FISH; MATE CHOICE	Anthropogenic environmental impacts can disrupt the sensory environment of animals and affect important processes from mate choice to predator avoidance. Currently, these effects are best understood for auditory and chemosensory modalities, and recent reviews highlight their importance for conservation. We examined how anthropogenic changes to the visual environment (ambient light, transmission, and backgrounds) affect visual communication and camouflage and considered the implications of these effects for conservation. Human changes to the visual environment can increase predation risk by affecting camouflage effectiveness, lead to maladaptive patterns of mate choice, and disrupt mutualistic interactions between pollinators and plants. Implications for conservation are particularly evident for disrupted camouflage due to its tight links with survival. The conservation importance of impaired visual communication is less documented. The effects of anthropogenic changes on visual communication and camouflage may be severe when they affect critical processes such as pollination or species recognition. However, when impaired mate choice does not lead to hybridization, the conservation consequences are less clear. We suggest that the demographic effects of human impacts on visual communication and camouflage will be particularly strong when human-induced modifications to the visual environment are evolutionarily novel (i.e., very different from natural variation); affected species and populations have low levels of intraspecific (genotypic and phenotypic) variation and behavioral, sensory, or physiological plasticity; and the processes affected are directly related to survival (camouflage), species recognition, or number of offspring produced, rather than offspring quality or attractiveness. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic effects on the visual environment may be of similar importance relative to conservation as anthropogenic effects on other sensory modalities.

One of such promising plants is sorghum grain, the main products of which are used for food, fodder and technical purposes. Almost every year, this crop in the steppe arid regions significantly exceeds traditional spring crops - oats, barley, corn and millet. In the State Register of Breeding Achievements Approved for Use in Russia for 2019, 120 domestic and foreign varieties and hybrids of grain sorghum were registered. The purpose of the research is to study the productivity of modern hybrids of sorghum grain in the soil and climatic conditions of the steppe zone on the basis of the Lugansk National Agrarian University in the crop rotation of the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Ecology (2016-2018). As a result of the studies, the most productive and maximally adapted crop varieties were established, which have the highest manufacturability and guaranteed maturation by the end of the growing season. In all the studied hybrids, no shedding of grain from panicles was recorded, even when the plants were stopped. The greatest damage to the leaves of cereal aphids was found in the wetter 2016. The average productivity of grain sorghum in the favorable year was 6.2 t / ha, in the arid year 2018 - 5.01 t / ha. On average, in 2016-2018, the highest yields (over 6.0 t / ha of grain) were obtained for early-ripening hybrids Frisket and PR88Y20 and mid-early Puma Star, Solarius and Bianka. These developments can be successfully implemented in agricultural production of the steppe regions of the North Caucasus region.

Flower age expressed in thermal time: is nectar secretion synchronous with pistil receptivity in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)?

Thermal time has been widely used to measure developmental age of plants and poikilothermic organisms. We tested whether thermal time was suitable to express flower age to characterise the duration of pistil receptivity and that of nectar secretion in undisturbed flowers of oilseed rape (OSR), and whether these two functional processes were synchronous. Flower age was measured in a male fertile hybrid F-1 line and in its male sterile (MS) parental line to determine if the presence of pollen affected the nectar secretion period. Hand pollinations and nectar samplings were conducted throughout the lifespan of OSR flowers on several flower cohorts from plants grown under tunnels under various temperature conditions. The number of seeds produced per flower was used as a proxy to assess the level of pistil receptivity at the time of hand-pollination. Thermal time was more suitable than calendar time to express OSR flower age. A phase of maturity followed by a phase of senescence took place in the two processes, and both proceeded faster as temperature increased. Nectar was secreted during the phase of full pistil receptivity, and, in the MS line, was then reabsorbed during the gradual decline of pistil receptivity. However, the nectar secretion period was extended beyond the onset of pistil senescence in the F-1 line. OSR flowers invest in nectar secretion to attract insect pollinators at least to cover the whole receptivity period of their female part. Nectar secretion may be prolonged in pollen-laden male fertile flowers to attract insect pollinators longer to ensure as long as possible the probability of their pollen being disseminated. Flower senescence is triggered by pistil senescence, while the presence of pollen in anthers acts as an inhibitor and therefore delays flower senescence. Thermal time should henceforth be used to express more universally the age of plant organs and to model the duration of processes in relation to temperature, especially in the advent of global warming.

Effects of forest management on biodiversity in temperate deciduous forests: An overview based on Central European beech forests	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION			English	Review						Forest management; Birds; Xylobionts; Saproxylic beetles; Forest plant species; Forest protection; Endangered forest species; Natura-2000 responsibility species	PLANT DIVERSITY; DEAD WOOD; PRODUCTIVITY; COMMUNITIES; RICHNESS; DYNAMICS; EXAMPLE; REGION; FLORA	This overview of relationships between biodiversity and management focuses on Central European Fagus forests. Present management and conservation activities are embedded in the geographic and historic background of Central European forest flora, including endangered, protected, and plant species for which Germany has taken special responsibility to ensure their future survival. Managed and unmanaged forests are compared with respect to plants and other organisms. Based on the floristic background, management for climate change and consequences of conservation on a global ecological footprint will be discussed. The Central European tree flora contains only about 7% of the tree diversity of East Asia. Only a few genera re-migrated to Central Europe after the Pleistocene, while others were lost during the Pleistocene, e.g. the genus Pseudotsuga. In this study the forest flora is characterized by specialized plant species that only grow in forests. These forest specialists contribute only 10% of the plant species of the total German flora. This fraction is even less (4-5%) for Romania which is generally regarded as a region with close to "natural" forest conditions. Also, the forest flora of Germany and Romania contains fewer apomictic and hybrid plant species than the non-forest flora. No forest plant species have gone extinct in Germany in the past 250 years, which is the time since the first floristic documentation of a plant species that was lost in Thuringia, despite intense forest use including changes in dominant tree species. With respect to the Natura 2000 goals of maintaining species diversity of Europe, the deciduous forest, as managed by rotation forestry, contain more protected and endangered species, and species for which Germany has taken responsibility than protected forest. Forests managed with permanent forest cover (so-called "management close-to-nature") contain fewer plant species than age-class (rotation) forestry. The abundance of dead wood-fungi and of soil bacteria is higher in rotation forest than in protected forests. For the initial phase of decay, a dead wood experiment identified two important tree species, Carpinus betulus and Picea abies, as the most preferred tree species for xylobionts. Carpinus has the most diverse fungal flora among all wood types and is a typical species for managed forests. The Natura 2000 habitat types were defined by plant species, but the assessment of ecosystem health is based on bird species in Central Europe. A time series extending from 1927 until 2015 indicates that most non-migratory forest bird species show an increasing abundance since 1970. Adding migrating and rare bird species populations resulted in constant average abundances since 1970. There is no evidence that sustainable forest management has led to decreased biodiversity in Central Europe. In view of climate change and increasing presence of tree diseases, Europe should avoid enlarging its ecological footprint by taking Central European forests out of management.	[Schulze, E.

Genetic variability of modern days crops must be broadened to make crop production more sustainable against various biotic and abiotic stresses which are posturing major threats to the world. It is therefore, crucial to identify novel additional sources of durable resistance. Wheat wild relatives have provided valuable sources of genetic diversity for various biotic, abiotic and quality components. In this respect wide hybridization has become a promising breeding method for introducing new variability in crop plants by using the crop wild relatives. In the present research work wheat-Th. Bessarabicum amphiploid, addition and translocation lines have been screened. These genetic stocks were exposed to 15% polyethylene glycerol (PEG) stress, to find out the drought tolerant addition and translocation lines by studying different physiological parameters. The screening of drought stress revealed that addition lines 2JJ, 4JJ, 5JJ, 7JJ and translocation line Tr-7 exhibited tolerance attitude towards water deficient conditions.

Therefore, future reproductive responses to climate change may be dependent on the timing of snowmelt. We combined genetic, morphological, and long-term monitoring data on Dryas from a High Arctic hybrid zone of D. integrifolia and D. octopetala to assess whether climate variation influenced flowering differently in areas of early and late snowmelt, and whether this could have a genetic origin. We found a non-linear relationship between timing of snowmelt and flowering. The duration of the period between snowmelt and the onset of flowering (pre-floration interval) varied with the date of snowmelt. Shorter pre-floration intervals were associated with warmer average temperature during the pre-floration intervals in both early and late melting plots. However, the pre-floration interval was much shorter in early than in late plots at the same average temperature. Likewise, the interannual variation in flower abundance differed between early and late melting plots. Flower abundance was negatively influenced by frost after snowmelt in the year of flowering in early plots. In late plots, flower abundance was positively influenced by the length of the previous growing season. We identified two morpho-types in the study area, but their distribution and genetic differentiation was not related to the snowmelt gradient. We conclude that the different flowering responses found along the snowmelt gradient are a result of environmental variation. Based on our results and projected climatic change for the study area, we predict that the onset of flowering will advance and flower abundance will increase in areas of early snowmelt. In areas of late snowmelt, the onset of flowering will remain unchanged or be delayed and flower abundance will decrease.

Aside from irreversible effects in ecosystems that could be triggered by the release of a gene drive, research on confinable drives or even the reversibility of gene drives is underway and shows first success under laboratory conditions. However, their effectiveness under realistic conditions is not entirely clear unless first test releases have taken place. Since a potentially irreversible intervention into ecosystems is created, a prospective assessment is needed. We present an approach of prospective ecological vulnerability analysis for the proposed control of the invasive pest Drosophila suzukii by using gene drives. The analysis considers the accidental spread of the gene drive to the native habitat of Drosophila suzukii, with a focus on Japan. It contains a mapping of potential impacts as a consequence of the suppression of the insect. Multiple cascading effects were identified including the potential spread of the gene drive in geographic range or potential hybridization with non-target species. Determining the vulnerability of an ecosystem requires information regarding specific characteristics at different organizational levels. The vulnerability analysis of an affected ecosystem will initially serve to identify gaps in knowledge. Reducing complexity and breaking down the potential events that might arise from a gene drive population suppression enables to better understand endpoints i.e. concrete effects. Three potential effects have been selected for a specific analysis of the vulnerability of populations and species. A high vulnerability was obtained for the suppression of non-target (native) populations of Drosophila suzukii as well as for a decrease in specialized parasitoid abundance. The paper proposes the outline of a comprehensive prospective approach to understand the susceptibility of an ecosystem to unintended and irreversible harm.

Conventional cotton (Gossypium sp) production technologies had significant effects on the environment and farm profitability in the past. New era transgenic or Bt cotton production technology can be used to simultaneously reduce the environmental footprint and enhance the profitability of cotton production. Information on these two sustainability aspects of transgenic cotton is missing in the scientific literature. Here, we review the potential advantages of insect tolerance Bt insect resistant technology used in hybrid cotton by comparing with the major cereal based rotations in India. Our results suggested that by using this technology, there was significant reduction in pesticide use roughly by 40%, and yield advantages of 30-40%. These resulted in saving on fossil fuels and decreasing CO2 emissions-which are major bonus for climate change mitigation. During the last decade, significant increase in cotton area and production in India is attributed to better returns realized by the farmers, which were largely due to better management practices followed to grow transgenic cotton. Most of the studies conducted in India, concluded that Bt-cotton is more efficient in input use and had a lower environmental impact quotient, which indicates less damage to the environment than non-Bt-cotton. However, Btcotton based cropping systems have less profitability and energy efficiency in comparison to the major cereal based rotations in India due to lesser productivity potential of cotton crop particularly in rain-fed ecosystems. This was mainly attributed to the lesser dissemination of proven energy-efficient research technologies to the farmer's fields. Although, Bt-cotton can contribute to a "sustainable intensification" strategy favoured by many science academies worldwide, which allows productivity/production to be increased in the current crop land, thereby saving forests and biodiversity.

Grape phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) - a review of potential detection and alternative management options	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY			English	Review						Biocontrol; detection; disinfestation; grape phylloxera; insecticides; quarantine; Vitis	SNOWDROP LECTIN; VITIS-VINIFERA; LEAF LECTIN; ROOT FORM; NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; METARHIZIUM-ANISOPLIAE; ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGI; ENHANCED RESISTANCE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; GAMMA-IRRADIATION	The management options for grape phylloxera, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, a monophagous insect pest of Vitis species are reviewed. Although in a worldwide context, grape phylloxera is managed predominantly by the use of resistant rootstocks developed through conventional breeding of hybrid crosses of American Vitis species, this management aspect is largely excluded from the review so that emerging technologies in the field of detection, quarantine and alternative management are discussed. In some viticulture regions of the world, where grape phylloxera's geographic distribution is limited (e.g. Australia), the pest is managed through a combination of surveillance, detection and quarantine. Although some alternative management options for grape phylloxera exist they have received relatively limited research attention because of the relative success of resistant rootstocks. The resilience of resistant rootstocks as the primary management option could also be challenged in the future by host-plant interactions with diverse grape phylloxera clonal lineages and by potential impacts of climate change on both grapevine and grape phylloxera distribution. A range of control options exist which could be integrated into an improved management system for grape phylloxera. Priority areas for future evaluation and further development include early detection techniques, investigation into the use of biological control agents and development of an integrated approach to grapevine phylloxera management.

This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Ulmus glabra Hudson (wych elm) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Ulmus glabra is a large forest tree, and often an important canopy tree in ancient and semi-natural woodlands. It is primarily native to the north and west of Britain and much of mainland Europe. It is the only elm native to Ireland. It is the most distinct of the British elms in that it rarely suckers and sets abundant viable seed. Although found on limestone screes and cliffs, and hedgerows, it is primarily a woodland tree, especially on moist, basic soils. In many secondary woodlands, it often co-occurs with Acer pseudoplatanus and has ecological needs that are similar to Fraxinus excelsior. 3. Ulmus glabra has clusters of c. 25 hermaphrodite flowers appearing before the leaves on previous year's growth. Seeds are wind-dispersed, falling in April to July, but remain viable for only a few days. Nevertheless, seedling establishment can be abundant. Hybridisation with other northern European elms is common but hybrids are notoriously difficult to identify and therefore probably under-recorded. 4. The health and survival of wych elm in Europe has been seriously compromised since the 1970s due to Dutch elm disease caused by the fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, transmitted by elm bark beetles (Scolytus spp.). To the south of its Scottish stronghold, many elms are reduced to small trees regrowing from basal sprouts or seeds. These trees tend to be reinfected once trunk diameter exceeds 10 cm. Fortunately for its long-term survival, seed production usually begins a number of years before they are reinfected.

Banks Grass Mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) Suppression May Add to the Benefit of Drought-Tolerant Corn Hybrids Exposed to Water Stress	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						spider mites; herbivory; pest outbreak; irrigation; arthropod-plant interaction	2-SPOTTED SPIDER-MITE; LIFE-HISTORY PARAMETERS; LEAF SENESCENCE; TEMPERATURE; RESISTANCE; RESPONSES; INSECT; PLANTS; YIELD; RATES	Spider mite (Acari: Tetranychidae) outbreaks are common on corn grown in the arid West. Hot and dry conditions reduce mite development time, increase fecundity, and accelerate egg hatch. Climate change is predicted to increase drought incidents and produce more intense temperature patterns. Together, these environmental shifts may cause more frequent and severe spider mite infestations. Spider mite management is difficult as many commercially available acaricides are ineffective due to the development of resistance traits in field mite populations. Therefore, alternative approaches to suppress outbreaks are critically needed. Drought-tolerant plant hybrids alleviate the challenges of growing crops in water-limited environments; yet, it is unclear if drought-tolerant hybrids exposed to water stress affect mite outbreaks under these conditions. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the effect of drought-tolerant corn hybrids on Banks grass mite [Oligonychus pratensis Banks (Acari: Tetranychidae)], a primary pest of corn, under optimal irrigation and water-stress irrigation. This was followed by a 2-yr field study investigating the effect of drought-tolerant corn hybrids exposed to the same irrigation treatments on Banks grass mite artificially infested on hybrids and resident spider mite populations. Results showed that water-stressed drought-tolerant hybrids had significantly lower Banks grass mite and resident spider mite populations than water-stressed drought-susceptible hybrids. Interestingly, water-stressed drought-tolerant hybrids had equal Banks grass mite populations to drought-susceptible and drought-tolerant hybrids under optimal irrigation. We posit that planting drought-tolerant hybrids may suppress spider mite outbreaks in water-challenged areas.

An explicit test of Pleistocene survival in peripheral versus nunatak refugia in two high mountain plant species	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Alps; coalescent simulations; nunataks; peripheral refugia; Pleistocene glaciation	NANUM L. GAUDIN; GLACIAL REFUGIA; GENETIC CONSEQUENCES; EUROPEAN ALPS; MOLECULAR PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; RAPD PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ALPINE; COLONIZATION	Pleistocene climate fluctuations had profound influence on the biogeographical history of many biota. As large areas in high mountain ranges were covered by glaciers, biota were forced either to peripheral refugia (and possibly beyond to lowland refugia) or to interior refugia (nunataks). However, nunatak survival remains controversial as it relies solely on correlative genetic evidence. Here, we test hypotheses of glacial survival using two high alpine plant species (the insect-pollinated Pedicularis asplenifolia and wind-pollinated Carex fuliginosa) in the European Alps. Employing the iDDC (integrative Distributional, Demographic and Coalescent) approach, which couples species distribution modelling, spatial and temporal demographic simulation and Approximate Bayesian Computation, we explicitly test three hypotheses of glacial survival: (a) peripheral survival only, (b) nunatak survival only and (c) peripheral plus nunatak survival. In P. asplenifolia the peripheral plus nunatak survival hypothesis was supported by Bayes factors (BF> 100), whereas in C. fuliginosa the peripheral survival only hypothesis, although best supported, could not be unambiguously distinguished from the peripheral plus nunatak survival hypothesis (BF = 5.58). These results are consistent with current habitat preferences (P. asplenifolia extends to higher elevations) and the potential for genetic swamping (i.e., replacement of local genotypes via hybridization with immigrating genotypes [expected to be higher in the wind-pollinated C. fuliginosa]). Although the persistence of plants on nunataks during glacial periods has been debated and studied over decades, this is one of the first studies to explicitly test the hypothesis instead of solely using correlative evidence.

J	Fischer, K				Fischer, Klara			Why new crop technology is not scale-neutral-A critique of the expectations for a crop-based African Green Revolution	RESEARCH POLICY			English	Article						Scale-neutral; Crop; Smallholder; Green Revolution; Biotechnology; SST	EASTERN CAPE PROVINCE; BT COTTON; GM CROPS; SMALL FARMS; AGRICULTURAL INNOVATIONS; INSECT RESISTANCE; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOUTH-AFRICA; BIOTECHNOLOGY	Poverty reduction during the Asian Green Revolution has been attributed to the inherent scale neutrality of new crop varieties making them equally beneficial to small-scale and large-scale farmers. The term 'scale-neutral' is now reappearing in debates on agricultural development in Africa with claims that crop technology is inherently scale-neutral and that African smallholders will significantly benefit from new crop varieties not specifically developed for their contexts. Using a social shaping of technology (SST) perspective and the concept of biological embeddedness, this paper critically examines whether it is helpful to describe crop technology as scale neutral when drawing lessons from the Asian Green Revolution about how new crop technology can be of benefit to African smallholders. The paper describes how political commitment, rather than inherently scale-neutral crops, was central for the outcome of the Asian Green Revolution. It also highlights that while the effects of crop biology are often disregarded in adoption studies, biology significantly affected the ability of Green Revolution crop technology to benefit smallholders, and continues to do so today. Using maize and GM crops as examples, this paper suggests that GM crops in their current form have reinforced a technological trajectory established with hybrid technology and directed it away from smallholder practices and agroecologies. Consequently, describing crop technology as inherently scale-neutral is not helpful for understanding how crop technology works in Africa today and prevents important lessons being learned from the Asian Green Revolution.

Whitebark is susceptible to multiple threats - climate change, white pine blister rust, mountain pine beetle, and fire exclusion - and it is suffering significant mortality range-wide, prompting the tree to be listed as `globally endangered' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and `endangered' by the Canadian government. Conservation collections (in situ and ex situ) are being initiated to preserve the genetic legacy of the species. Reliable, transferrable, and highly variable genetic markers are essential for quantifying the genetic profiles of seed collections relative to natural stands, and ensuring the completeness of conservation collections. We evaluated the use of hybridization-based target capture to enrich specific genomic regions from the 27 GB genome of whitebark pine, and to evaluate genetic variation across loci, trees, and geography. Probes were designed to capture 7,849 distinct genes, and screening was performed on 48 trees. Despite the inclusion of repetitive elements in the probe pool, the resulting dataset provided information on 4,452 genes and 32% of targeted positions (528,873 bp), and we were able to identify 12,390 segregating sites from 47 trees. Variations reveal strong geographic trends in heterozygosity and allelic richness, with trees from the southern Cascade and Sierra Range showing the greatest distinctiveness and differentiation. Our results show that even under non-optimal conditions (low enrichment efficiency; inclusion of repetitive elements in baits), targeted enrichment produces high quality, codominant genotypes from large genomes. The resulting data can be readily integrated into management and gene conservation activities for whitebark pine, and have the potential to be applied to other members of 5-needle pine group (Pious subsect. Quinquefolia) due to their limited genetic divergence.

These storms can cause severe forest damage, provoking direct and indirect economic losses for forestry. To minimize economic losses, the windthrow areas need to be detected fast to prevent subsequent biotic damage, for example, related to beetle infestations. Remote sensing is an efficient tool with high potential to cost-efficiently map large storm affected regions. Storm Niklas hit South Germany in March 2015 and caused widespread forest cover loss. We present a two-step change detection approach applying commercial very high-resolution optical Earth Observation data to spot forest damage. First, an object-based bi-temporal change analysis is carried out to identify windthrow areas larger than 0.5 ha. For this purpose, a supervised Random Forest classifier is used, including a semi-automatic feature selection procedure; for image segmentation, the large-scale mean shift algorithm was chosen. Input features include spectral characteristics, texture, vegetation indices, layer combinations and spectral transformations. A hybrid-change detection approach at pixel-level subsequently identifies small groups of fallen trees, combining the most important features of the previous processing step with Spectral Angle Mapper and Multivariate Alteration Detection. The methodology was evaluated on two test sites in Bavaria with RapidEye data at 5 m pixel resolution. The results regarding windthrow areas larger than 0.5 ha were validated with reference data from field visits and acquired through orthophoto interpretation. For the two test sites, the novel object-based change detection approach identified over 90% of the windthrow areas (>= 0.5 ha). The red edge channel was the most important for windthrow identification. Accuracy levels of the change detection at tree level could not be calculated, as it was not possible to collect field data for single trees, nor was it possible to perform an orthophoto validation. Nevertheless, the plausibility and applicability of the pixel-based approach is demonstrated on a second test site.

Given the speed at which these changes are occurring, one of society's major challenges is to coexist within ecosystems and to manage ecosystem services in a sustainable way. The effect of possible scenarios of global change on ecosystem services can be explored using ecosystem models. Such models should adequately represent ecosystem processes above and below the soil surface (aboveground and belowground) and the interactions between them. We explore possibilities to include such interactions into ecosystem models at scales that range from global to local. At the regional to global scale we suggest to expand the plant functional type concept (aggregating plants into groups according to their physiological attributes) to include functional types of aboveground-belowground interactions. At the scale of discrete plant communities, process-based and organism-oriented models could be combined into "hybrid approaches" that include organism-oriented mechanistic representation of a limited number of trophic interactions in an otherwise process - oriented approach. Under global change the density and activity of organisms determining the processes may change non-linearly and therefore explicit knowledge of the organisms and their responses should ideally be included. At the individual plant scale a common organism-based conceptual model of aboveground-belowground interactions has emerged. This conceptual model facilitates the formulation of research questions to guide experiments aiming to identify patterns that are common within, but differ between, ecosystem types and biomes. Such experiments inform modelling approaches at larger scales. Future ecosystem models should better include this evolving knowledge of common patterns of aboveground-belowground interactions. Improved ecosystem models are necessary toots to reduce the uncertainty in the information that assists us in the sustainable management of our environment in a changing world.

These questions range from the stability and fate of hybrid zones to the relative fitness of hybrids. In this paper we report the results of a 14-year survey of the Allonemobius fasciatus-Allonemobius socius hybrid zone. Populations were collected intensively in 1986 and 1987 and then more sporadically through the end of the 1980s and throughout the 1990s. By documenting changes in the genetic composition of populations near and within the zone during this period of time we assessed: the strength of the reproductive isolation between the two species; the relative growth rates (which can be considered a surrogate of relative fitness) of genotype classes corresponding to hybrids and to pure species individuals; and, the power of single-year and multi-year measurements of relative growth rates to predict changes in the genetic composition of mixed populations through time. In brief, we found very large year-to-year variation in the relative growth rates of pure species and hybrid individuals. This variation may reflect the fact that both species are at the edge of their range and perhaps at the limits of their ability to deal with environmental perturbations. As a consequence of the variation, even multi-year estimates of relative growth rates often provided imprecise predictions regarding the future genotypic composition of mixed populations. Despite our limited ability to predict the dynamics of individual populations, some trends are apparent. A. socius, the southern species, has clearly increased in frequency along a transect through the Appalachian Mountains, indicating that the zone is moving north in this region. In contrast, the zone appeared to be more stable along the East Coast transect. Within mixed populations, character-index profiles are often bimodal and stable through time, indicating relatively strong reproductive isolation between the two species that is not being reinforced, nor is it breaking down.

We have successfully developed various highly efficient, stable, and selective photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction using transition metal complexes as both photosensitizers and catalysts. The molecular architectures for constructing selective and efficient photocatalytic systems for CO2 reduction are discussed herein. As a typical example, a mixed system of a ring-shaped Re(I) trinuclear complex as a photosensitizer and fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)(3){OC2H4N(C2H4OH)(2)}] as a catalyst selectively photocatalyzed CO2 reduction to CO with the highest quantum yield of 82% and a turnover number (TON) of over 600. Not only rare and noble metals but also earth abundant ones, such as Mn(I), Cu(I), and Fe(II) can be used as central metal cations. In the case using a Cu(I) dinuclear complex as a photosensitizer and fac-Mn(bpy)(CO)(3)Br as a catalyst, the total formation quantum yield of CO and HCOOH from CO2 was 57% and TONCO+HCOOH exceeded 1300. Efficient supramolecular photocatalysts for CO2 reduction, in which photosensitizer and catalyst units are connected through a bridging ligand, were developed for removing a diffusion control on collisions between a photosensitizer and a catalyst. Supramolecular photocatalysts, in which [Ru(N<^>N)(3)](2+)-type photosensitizer and Re(I) or Ru(II) catalyst units are connected to each other with an alkyl chain, efficiently and selectively photocatalyzed CO2 reduction in solutions. Mechanistic studies using time-resolved IR and electrochemical measurements provided molecular architecture for constructing efficient supramolecular photocatalysts. A Ru(II)-Re(I) supramolecular photocatalyst constructed according to this molecular architecture efficiently photocatalyzed CO2 reduction even when it was fixed on solid materials. Harnessing this property of the supramolecular photocatalysts, two types of hybrid photocatalytic systems were developed, namely, photocatalysts with light-harvesting capabilities and photoelectrochemical systems for CO2 reduction. Introduction of light-harvesting capabilities into molecular photocatalytic systems should be important because the intensity of solar light shone on the earth's surface is relatively low. Periodic mesoporous organosilica, in which methyl acridone groups are embedded in the silica framework as light harvesters, was combined with a Ru(II)-Re(I) supramolecular photocatalyst with phosphonic acid anchoring groups. In this hybrid, the photons absorbed by approximately 40 methyl acridone groups were transferred to one Ru(II) photosensitizer unit, and then, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction commenced. To use water as an abundant electron donor, we developed hybrid photocatalytic systems combining metal-complex photocatalysts with semiconductor photocatalysts that display high photooxidation powers, in which two photons are sequentially absorbed by the metal-complex photosensitizer and the semiconductor, resulting in both high oxidation and reduction power. Various types of dye sensitized molecular photocathodes comprising the p-type semiconductor electrodes and the supramolecular photocatalysts were developed. Full photoelectrochemical cells combining these dye-sensitized molecular photocathodes and n-type semiconductor photoanodes achieved CO2 reduction using only visible light as the energy source and water as the reductant. Drastic improvement of dye-sensitized molecular photocathodes is reported. The results presented in this Account clearly indicate that we can construct very efficient, selective, and durable photocatalytic systems constructed with the metal-complex photosensitizers and catalysts. The supramolecular-photocatalyst architecture in which the photosensitizer and the catalyst are connected to each other is useful especially on the surface of solid owing to rapid electron transfer from the photosensitizer to the catalyst. On basis of these findings, we successfully constructed hybrid systems of the supramolecular photocatalysts with photoactive solid materials. These hybridizations can add new functions to the metal-complex photocatalytic systems, such as water oxidation and light harvesting.

Conservation biology of banksias: insights from natural history to simulation modelling	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Advances in Plant Conservation Biology - Implications for Management and Restoration	OCT 25-27, 2005	Perth, AUSTRALIA				CANOPY SEED STORAGE; FIRE-PRONE ENVIRONMENTS; ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE; PHYTOPHTHORA-CINNAMOMI; POLLINATION BIOLOGY; COMMERCIAL PICKING; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; WATER RELATIONS; PLANT-AGE; DYNAMICS	We have studied the ecology and conservation requirements of Banksia species in the species-rich sandplains of south-western Australia for 25 years. Loss of habitat through land-clearing has had the greatest impact on their conservation status over the last 50 years. Ascertaining optimal conditions for conservation management in bushland requires detailed knowledge of the species under consideration, including demographic attributes, fire regime, growing conditions and interactions with other species. Where populations have been fragmented, seed production per plant has also fallen. The group most vulnerable to the vagaries of fire, disease, pests, weeds and climate change are the non-sprouters, rather than the resprouters, with population extinction so far confined to non-sprouting species. Recent short-interval fires (< 8 years) appear to have had little impact at the landscape scale, possibly because they are rare and patchy. Fire intervals exceeding 25-50 years can also lead to local extinction. Up to 200 viable seeds are required for parent replacement in Banksia hookeriana when growing conditions are poor (low post-fire rainfall, commercial flower harvesting) and seed banks of this size can take up to 12 years to be reached. Seed production is rarely limited by pollinators, but interannual seasonal effects and resource availability are important. Genetic diversity of the seed store is quickly restored to the level of the parents in B. hookeriana. Florivores and granivores generally reduce seed stores, although this varies markedly among species. In Banksia tricuspis, black cockatoos actually increase seed set by selectively destroying borers. Potential loss of populations through the root pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi also challenges management, especially in the southern sandplains. Prefire dead plants are a poor source of seeds for the next generation when fire does occur. Harvesting seeds and sowing post-fire have much to commend them for critically endangered species. Bare areas caused by humans can result in ideal conditions for plant growth and seed set. However, in the case of B. hookeriana/B. prionotes, disturbance by humans has fostered hybridisation, threatening the genetic integrity of both species, whereas fine-textured soils are unsuitable for colonisation or rehabilitation. Few viable seeds become seedlings after fire, owing to post-release granivory and herbivory and unsuitable germination conditions. Seedling-competitive effects ensure that season/intensity of fire is not critical to recruitment levels, except in the presence of weeds. Water availability during summer-autumn is critical and poses a problem for conservation management if the trend for declining rainfall in the region continues. Our simulation modelling for three banksias shows that the probability of co-occurrence is maximal when fire is stochastic around a mean of 13 years, and where fire-proneness and post-fire recruitment success vary in the landscape. Modelling results suggest that non-sprouting banksias could not survive the pre-European frequent-fire scenario suggested by the new grasstree technique for south-western Australia. However, we have yet to fully explore the conservation significance of long-distance dispersal of seeds, recently shown to exceed 2.5 km in B. hookeriana.

In wheat, access to this diversity and its exploitation is based upon the genetic distance of the wild species relatives from the wheat genomes. For several decades, these wide crosses have been a reservoir of novel variation for wheat improvement. Among these, close relatives of the primary gene pool have been preferred since this ensures successful gene transfer as they permit homologous genetic exchanges to occur between related genomes, as exemplified by the A and D genome diploid progenitors. One strategy has been based upon first producing genetic stocks that capture the potential of the diploids via bridge crossing where the D genome synthetic hexaploid wheats (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) are exploited. The synthetics are products of crosses between elite durum wheat cultivars (Triticum turgidum) and various Aegilops tauschii accessions. Similarly, the diversity of the A and B genomes has also been assembled as AABBAA (T. turgidum/A genome diploids Triticum boeoticum, Triticum monococcum, Triticum urartu) and AABBBB (SS) (T. turgidum/Aegilops speltoides). The utilization of these useful diversity for various biotic/abiotic stresses including in the development of molecular tools for enhancing breeding efficiency has been in the forefront of wheat improvement over the past two decades. Additional strategy employed includes the direct crosses between parental diploids and recipient wheat cultivars extended to give even swifter products by top- or backcrossing the F-1 combinations with either durum or bread wheats. Relatively less progress has been made in the use of genes from tertiary gene pool often involving "intergeneric crosses." The potency of potentially useful diversity in tertiary gene pool warrants further exploitation of this resource. Presented here are major facets of intergeneric hybridization embracing a taxonomic consideration of genetic diversity within the Triticeae, the exploitation protocols, prebreeding strategies, and some of the outputs from distant hybridization with a major focus on wheat/alien chromosomal exchanges classed as "translocations" such as T1BL.1RS and to a lesser degree the T1AL.1RS Robertsonian translocations. This chapter also attempts to relate the exploitation of the Triticeae genetic diversity with wheat productivity as a means of addressing diverse stress constraints that if pursued will provide yield enhancing outputs necessary for overriding environmental limitations of climate change, unpredictable incidences of biotic stresses, and catalyzing gains for food security with wheat.

Modelling West Nile virus transmission risk in Europe: effect of temperature and mosquito biotypes on the basic reproduction number	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CULEX-PIPIENS DIPTERA; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; EXPERIMENTAL-INFECTION; VECTOR COMPETENCE; FEEDING PATTERNS; LINEAGE 1; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DISEASE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; POPULATION	West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which has caused repeated outbreaks in humans in southern and central Europe, but thus far not in northern Europe. The main mosquito vector for WNV, Culex pipiens, consists of two behaviourally distinct biotypes, pipiens and molestus, which can form hybrids. Differences between biotypes, such as vector competence and host preference, could be important in determining the risk of WNV outbreaks. Risks for WNV establishment can be modelled with basic reproduction number (R-0) models. However, existing R0 models have not differentiated between biotypes. The aim of this study was, therefore, to explore the role of temperature-dependent and biotype-specific effects on the risk of WNV establishment in Europe. We developed an R0 model with temperature-dependent and biotype-specific parameters, and calculated R0 values using the next-generation matrix for several scenarios relevant for Europe. In addition, elasticity analysis was done to investigate the contribution of each biotype to R0. Global warming and increased mosquito-to-host ratios can possibly result in more intense WNV circulation in birds and spill-over to humans in northern Europe. Different contributions of the Cx. pipiens biotypes to R0 shows the importance of including biotype-specific parameters in models for reliable WNV risk assessments.	[Vogels, Chantal B.

Competitive displacement of L. sativae by L. trifolii occurred during the expansion process of the latter in southern China, while whether L. trifolii can expand their range to northern China remains unclear. Overwintering and cold tolerance capacity largely determine the species distribution range and can affect species displacement through overwintering and phenology. In this study, we compared the overwintering potential, cold tolerance and supercooling point (SCP) between these two leafminer species. Our results showed that L. trifolii can overwinter at higher altitudes than L. sativae. In addition, we found that they can both successfully overwinter in greenhouses in northern China, and the overwintering capacity of L. trifolii was higher than that of L. sativae. Moreover, the extreme low-temperature survival of L. trifolii was significantly higher than that of L. sativae, and the SCP of the former was lower than that of the latter. We thus conclude that the overwintering and cold tolerance capacity of L. trifolii is much better than that of L. sativae. Our findings indicate that L. trifolii has the potential to displace L. sativae and expand its range to northern China. Moreover, our results have important implications for predicting overwinter ranges and developing management strategies for invasive leafminers in China.

High altitude areas that were previously unsuitable for the spread of mosquito vector populations could become suitable. The aim of this research was to study the distribution of mosquito species in higher altitude regions of Croatia. Samples were collected in three areas: Slavonian Mountains, Gorski Kotar, and Middle Velebit. Specimens were morphologically determined and confirmed by DNA barcoding and other genetic markers and showed the presence of 16 species belonging to six genera. The most abundant species were the Culex pipiens complex with 50% of the collected specimens. Both pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758) and molestus (Forskal, 1775) biotypes and their hybrids were identified within the complex, followed by Culex torrentium (Martini, 1925) (20.2%), Culiseta longiareolata (Macquart, 1838) (8.5%), and the invasive species Aedes japonicus (Theobald, 1901) (7.8% of the total number of collected specimens). The remaining 12 species made up 14.7% of the collected specimens. Intraspecific COI p-distances were within the standard barcoding threshold for OTUs, while interspecific genetic distances were much higher, confirming the existence of barcoding gaps. Mosquito fauna of Croatian mountains showed a moderate variety and made 30.8% of the total number of recorded mosquito species in Croatia thus far.

The reaction-advection-diffusion equation takes the form u(t)((m)) =div(A del u((m))-qu((m)))+f (u((m))) for (x, t) is an element of R-n x (0, 1], for some function f, a drift q, and a diffusion matrix A. When the discrete-time map is local in space we use N-m(x) to denote the density of population at a point x at the beginning of reproductive season in the mth year, and when the map is nonlocal we use u(m)(x). The local discrete-time map is {u((m))(x, 0) = g(N-m(x)) for x is an element of R-n, Nm+1(x) := u((m))(x,1) for x is an element of R-n} for some function g. The nonlocal discrete time map is {u((m))(x, 0) = u(m)(x) for x is an element of R-n, u(m+1) :g(integral(Rn) K(x - y)u((m))(y, 1)dy) for x is an element of R-n}, when K is a nonnegative normalized kernel. Here, we analyze the above model from a variety of perspectives so as to understand the phenomenon of propagation. We provide explicit formulas for the spreading speed of propagation in any direction e is an element of R-n. Due to the structure of the model, we apply a simultaneous analysis of the differential equation and the recurrence relation to establish the existence of traveling wave solutions. The remarkable point is that the roots of spreading speed formulas, as a function of drift, are exactly the values that yield blow-up for the critical domain dimensions, just as with the classical Fisher's equation with advection. We provide applications of our main results to impulsive reaction-advection-diffusion models describing periodically reproducing populations subject to climate change, insect populations in a stream environment with yearly reproduction, and grass growing logistically in the savannah with asymmetric seed dispersal and impacted by periodic fires.

The core distribution area of KSR is Liping, Congjiang and Rongjiang County of southeast, Guizhou Province. Paddy fields, forests, livestock and cottages have formed a special artificial wetland ecosystem in local area, and the Dong people have also formed a set of traditional farming systems of KSR for variety breeding, field management, and soil and water conservation. However, this traditional agricultural management has not been reported at multiple levels based on landraces, species and ecosystems. Methods Fieldwork was conducted in ten villages in southeast Guizhou from 2019 to 2021. A total of 229 informants were interviewed from the villages. Semi-structured and key informant interviews were administered to collect ethnoecological data on the characteristics and traditional utilization of KSR, traditional farming systems and agricultural management of the Dong people. Results (1): A total of 57 KSR landraces were recorded as used by the Dong people in southeast Guizhou. We analyzed the cultural importance index (CII) of all KSRs. KSR with high CII often has a pleasant taste, special biological characteristics of cold resistance, disease and insect resistance and high utilization in the traditional culture of Dong people. (2) There is a clear division of labor between men and women in the breeding, seed retention, field management and grain storage management of different landraces of KSR in Dong communities. In order to resist natural disasters and insect pests, the cultivation of KSR is usually managed by multi-variety mixed planting. These agricultural management modes are the result of Dong people's understanding and adaptation to the local natural geographical environment, as well as the experience and wisdom crystallization of Dong people's long-term practice. (3) The traditional farmland of Dong People is a typical artificial wetland ecosystem that is planted with mixed KSR landraces with rich traditional wisdom. In addition, the economic benefit of the rice-fish-duck symbiotic system was 3.07 times that of hybrid rice alone; therefore, the rice-fish-duck system not only has the function of maintaining soil, water and ecological balance but also improves the income of Dong people. Conclusion KSR is a special kind of rice that has been domesticated and cultivated by Dong people for thousands of years. Dong people have also formed traditional agriculture dominated by KSR cultivation. The traditional agricultural management of Dong people provides suitable habitats for flora and fauna with biodiversity protection, and convenient conditions for rational utilization and distribution of water resources were also provided. This traditional management mode is of great significance for environmental protection, climate change response, community resource management, sustainable utilization and agricultural transformation in modern society. Therefore, we call for interdisciplinary research in natural and social sciences, in-depth study of the ecological culture of ethnic areas, and sort out treasures conducive to the development of all mankind.

This species is an urban container-breeding mosquito whose close contact with humans and flexibility in host choice has led to its classification as a "bridge vector"; that is, it is thought to move zoonotic diseases to humans from vertebrate reservoirs. While this invasive species is now well documented in its established range, which expanded in 2001 to include Canada, the existence of populations of this species along the fringes of its range are less well known. Here we report, using morphological and genetic techniques, the existence of two locations where Cx. pipiens exists in Newfoundland in both expected and unexpected sites based on projected habitat suitability on the island.

CRANTZ; HUNGARY ACARI; POLLEN FLOW; WILDSERVICE TREE; GENUS SORBUS; FOREST TREE	1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Sorbus torminalis (L.) Crantz (Wild Service-tree) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Sorbus torminalis is an uncommon, mostly small tree (but can reach 33 m) native to lowland England and Wales, and temperate and Mediterranean regions of mainland Europe. It is the most shade-tolerant member of the genus in the British Isles, and as a result, it is more closely associated with woodland than any other British species. Like other British Sorbus species, however, it grows best where competition for space and sunlight is limited. Seedlings are shade tolerant but adults are only moderately so. This, combined with its low competitive ability, restricts the best growth to open areas. In shade, saplings and young adults form a sapling bank, showing reproduction and extensive growth only when released. Sorbus torminalis tolerates a wide range of soil reaction (pH 3.5-8.0) but grows best on calcareous clays and thin soils over limestone. 3. Sorbus torminalis is a sexual, diploid, non-apomictic species that has hybridised with a number of other Sorbus species to form microspecies. The hermaphrodite flowers are primarily insect pollinated. Seed production is reliable only in warm years, especially at the edge of its range, although even then seed viability is low. The fruits are primarily dispersed by carnivorous mammals. Seeds display embryo dormancy but most will germinate the first spring after falling. 4. This tree is very tolerant of short droughts but only moderately tolerant of frost, hence its southerly and lowland distribution. It faces no particular individual threats although the small size of most populations makes it susceptible to habitat loss and fragmentation, particularly through the loss of open coppiced areas. As a consequence, it appears to be declining throughout Britain and Europe despite its wide range of historical uses and the high value of its timber. The extent to which these losses will be offset by increases due to climate change is unknown.

Temperatures exceeded the preceding 50 yr averages in all locations for most of January, whereas rainfall vas absent or below average. Abundance of Culex Species in traps during January ranged from 83 to 671% of the prior 5 yr average in all locations. Few females collected resting were in diapause during January based oil follicular measurements. Evidence for early season gonotrophic activity included the detection of freshly bloodfed. gravid, and parous females ill resting collections, gravid oviposition site-seeking females in gravid female traps, and nulliparous and parous host-seeking females at dry ice-baited traps, Female Culex seemed to employ multiple overwintering strategies in California, including larval and adult quiescence, adult female diapause, and all intermediate situation with adult females collected with enlarged follicles, but without evident vitellogenesis. West Nile, St. Louis, or western equine encephalitis viruses were not detected in 198 pools of adults or 56 pools of adults reared from field-collected immatures collected during January and February 2009. Our preliminary data may provide insight into how climate change may extend the mosquito season in California.

However, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wood nematode, is also a pathogen of trees and is the causal agent of pine wilt disease. B. xylophilus is native to North America and here it causes little damage to trees. Where it is introduced to new regions it causes huge damage. The most severely affected areas are found in the Far East but more recently B. xylophilus has been introduced into Portugal and the potential for damage here is also high. As incidence and severity of pine wilt disease are linked to temperature we suggest that climate change is likely to exacerbate the problems caused by B. xylophilus and, in addition, will extend (northwards in Europe) the range in which pine wilt disease can occur. Here we review what is currently known about the interactions of B. xylophilus with its hosts, including recent developments in our understanding of the molecular biology of pathogenicity in the nematode. We also examine the potential developments that could be made by more widespread use of genomics tools to understand interactions between B. xylophilus, bacterial pathogens that have been implicated in disease and host trees.

Inputs of nitrogen-rich leaf litter from alder into stream food webs can contribute significantly to nitrogen dynamics at local and landscape scales. Alder trees also provide habitats for terrestrial and aquatic organisms, and help stabilize river banks. Recently, substantial declines in alder stands have occurred along streams in Europe, with damages observed in some parts of North America also. A major driver has been the invasive oomycete pathogen Phytophthora alni species complex, which can spread rapidly along stream networks. This review synthesises information on the pathogen, processes of spread and infection, and its impacts on alder. We further address the potential ecosystem-level and management consequences of the decline of alder, and highlight research needs. The alder dieback caused by P. alni is associated with reductions in shade and quality and quantity of leaf litter. A decline in the structural integrity of branches and roots further threatens bank stability. Stream banks dominated by other tree species or no trees at all will result in ecosystem-level changes both above and below the waterline. The P. alni taxonomic complex includes different species with varying phenotypes. An improved understanding of their environmental tolerances, virulence and evolution, along with the processes regulating the spread and impacts of the pathogen, would assist in identification of the riparian and stream systems most vulnerable not only to invasion but also to the heaviest disease outbreaks and ecosystem-level impacts. Within the P. alni complex, the highly pathogenic hybrid species P. x alni is favoured by mild winters and warm, but not excessively hot summer temperatures suggesting possible changes in distribution and level of impact under future global climate change.

The low-yield hybrid cotton system of India contributes thousands of farmer suicides to the annual national toll. Conceptual and methodological barriers have hindered bioeconomic analysis of the ecological and social sustainability of such cross-scale agro-ecological problems in time and geographic space, under global technology and climate change. As a paradigm shift, we use conceptually simple, parameter-sparse, theoretically based, mechanistic, weather-driven physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) to deconstruct the bio-economics of the Indian cotton system. Results Our analysis of Indian hybrid cotton system explains some extant ecological and economic problems, and suggests a viable solution. Specifically, the model accurately captured the age-stage mass dynamics of rainfed and irrigated cotton growth/development and the interactions with the key pest pink bollworm across five south-central Indian states, and enabled identification of proximate bioeconomic factors responsible for low yield and their relationship to farmer suicides. The results are reinforced by analysis of Ministry of Agriculture annual state-level data. We explain why short-season, high-density non-GM cotton is a highly viable solution for Indian cotton farmers in rainfed and irrigated cotton areas of the five states, and possibly nationally. The transition from a theoretical bioeconomic construct to a real-world regional bioeconomic analysis proved seamless. Conclusions The hybrid long-season Bt technology for rainfed and irrigated cotton is unique to India, and is a value capture mechanism. This technology is suboptimal leading to stagnant yields, high input costs, increased insecticide use, and low farmer incomes that increase economic distress that is a proximate cause of cotton farmer suicides. The current GM Bt technology adds costs in rainfed cotton without commensurate increases in yield. Non-GM pure-line high-density short-season varieties could double rainfed cotton yield, reduce costs, decrease insecticide use, and help ameliorate suicides. The GM hybrid technology is inappropriate for incorporation in short-season high-density varieties.
