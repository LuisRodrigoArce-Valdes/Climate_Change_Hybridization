Importation biological control of invasive fire ants with parasitoid phorid flies-progress and prospects	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL			English	Review						Imported fire ants; Phorid fly; Pseudacteon; Solenopsis invicta; Solenopsis richteri; Solenopsis saevissima	PSEUDACTEON-CURVATUS DIPTERA; SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA BUREN; DECAPITATING FLY; HYMENOPTERA-FORMICIDAE; HOST-SPECIFICITY; RANGE EXPANSION; INTRODUCED POPULATIONS; NORTH-AMERICA; FIELD RELEASE; SOCIAL FORM	Twenty-two known species of Pseudacteon flies (Diptera: Phoridae) are parasitoids of South American fire ants in the Solenopsis saevissima (Smith) complex. Phorid flies of different sizes and with differing activity patterns have been released in the United States to control two imported fire ant species-Solenopsis richteri and Solenopsis invicta-and their hybrid. Six highly host-specific Pseudacteon species have been successfully established at dozens of release sites and most are now widely distributed across areas infested by imported fire ants. This complex of released fly species is expected to weaken the competitive vigor of fire ant colonies through both direct and indirect effects, and eventually reduce the abundance of imported fire ants. To date, however, few studies have attempted to document the effect of these parasitoids on host ants in the field, and future research should focus on the overall magnitude of reduction in host ant populations. Knowledge gained from the successful importation and establishment of South American phorid flies in the US can provide guidance for utilization of these parasitoid flies for biological control of S. invicta in other introduced ranges, and aid the search for additional importation biological control agents of pest ants in general.

Parallel evolution in sympatric, hybridizing species: performance of Colias butterflies on their introduced host plants	ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA			English	Article						alfalfa; clover; host-range expansion; introgression; larval ecology; trade-off; Lepidoptera; Pieridae	HERBIVOROUS LADYBIRD BEETLE; SULFUR BUTTERFLIES; PHILODICE LEPIDOPTERA; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; PIERID BUTTERFLIES; LARVAL PERFORMANCE; RANGE EVOLUTION; TRADE-OFFS; 2 RACES	Shared ancestry and introgression can contribute to genetic similarity between hybridizing species, and it is generally difficult to disentangle these causes. However, shared ancestry plays a more limited role in traits that have recently undergone parallel directional selection in the two species, permitting the role of introgression to be better understood. The butterflies Colias eurytheme (Boisduval) and Colias philodice (Godart) (Lepidoptera, Pieridae) are native to North America and have shifted their host ranges in parallel onto several introduced weedy and agricultural legumes. These butterflies hybridize at moderate rates throughout their range, and there is a strong possibility that they could be sharing host-associated adaptations. We split families of each species among nine introduced, prospective hosts and measured survivorship, larval duration, pupal weight, and a new variable, effective daily growth rate (DGR), analogous to a compound daily interest rate in economics. We found strong effects of host, sex, and family (species), but negligible effects of the host*species interaction that would indicate species-specific differences in performance on different hosts. We found species-specific life-history differences: C. eurytheme matured significantly later and reached a significantly larger body size than C. philodice while growing at the same DGR. Protandry was strong, and males, in addition to pupating sooner than females, grew significantly faster than females as measured by DGR. We measured broad-sense heritabilities and genetic correlations for host-associated performance variables. Most pairwise comparisons of performance among hosts and most pairwise comparisons between performance variables showed positive genetic correlations, except survivorship where little heritability was found. Nevertheless, a factorial multivariate analysis of variance of G-matrices showed highly significant species, host, and host*species interactions, suggesting differentially evolving genetic architectures underlying host adaptation in these two species, despite the small differences in overall performance. At least some of the genes affecting host performance in Colias are likely to be in the small, species-diagnostic regions and not shared via introgression between these hybridizing species. For biologists interested in the evolutionary ecology of their host associations, including applied biologists managing their agricultural pest potential, C. eurytheme and C. philodice are most usefully studied as if they were a single polymorphic species wherever they co-exist. In studying species that hybridize readily with a sympatric congener, it may often be necessary to include the second species in the experimental design.

We sought to predict the overall impact of climate change on venomous terrestrial species. We hypothesize that given the close relationship between terrestrial venomous species and climate, a changing global environment may result in increased species migration, geographical redistribution, and longer seasons for envenomation, which would have repercussions on human health. Methods A retrospective analysis of environmental, ecological, and medical literature was performed with a focus on climate change, toxinology, and future modeling specific to venomous terrestrial creatures. Species included venomous reptiles, snakes, arthropods, spiders, and Hymenoptera (ants and bees). Animals that are vectors of hemorrhagic infectious disease (eg, mosquitos, ticks) were excluded. Results Our review of the literature indicates that changes to climatic norms will have a potentially dramatic effect on terrestrial venomous creatures. Empirical evidence demonstrates that geographic distributions of many species have already shifted due to changing climatic conditions. Given that most terrestrial venomous species are ectotherms closely tied to ambient temperature, and that climate change is shifting temperature zones away from the equator, further significant distribution and population changes should be anticipated. For those species able to migrate to match the changing temperatures, new geographical locations may open. For those species with limited distribution capabilities, the rate of climate change may accelerate faster than species can adapt, causing population declines. Specifically, poisonous snakes and spiders will likely maintain their population numbers but will shift their geographic distribution to traditionally temperate zones more often inhabited by humans. Fire ants and Africanized honey bees are expected to have an expanded range distribution due to predicted warming trends. Human encounters with these types of creatures are likely to increase, resulting in potential human morbidity and mortality. Conclusions Temperature extremes and changes to climatic norms may have a dramatic effect on venomous terrestrial species.

A statewide survey was conducted in Louisiana during 2009 and 2010 to determine the distribution of Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier and Pseudacteon curvatus Borgmeier, and to quantify the potential spatial association between the two species. Additionally, collected phorid flies were tested for the microsporidium Kneallhazia (=Thelohania) solenopsae (Knell, Allen, and Hazard), another natural enemy of fire ants, to establish an account of the pathogen's distribution and prevalence in phorid fly populations. P. tricuspis and P. curvatus have expanded their range from four and three separate release sites, respectively, in Louisiana. By 2010, P. tricuspis and P. curvatus occupied approximately 86,600 and 111,900 km(2), respectively. Overall, P. curvatus was more abundant than P. tricuspis, with 41.9 +/- 7.3 (SE) and 9.8 +/- 1.5 (SE) females, respectively, collected on average per sampling site in 2009. Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) suggested aggregation for the two phorid fly species. P. tricuspis collections were positively associated with P. curvatus collections, indicating that gaps and clusters of both species generally overlapped. K. solenopsae was detected in 22 of 64 parishes, and among 124 collection sites tested, 19% yielded positive responses for K. solenopsae. P. tricuspis males and females and P. curvatus females were found to harbor K. solenopsae. This study is the first to detect K. solenopsae in P. tricuspis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adaptive maintenance of European alleles in the Brazilian Africanized honeybee	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						adaptation; genomics; honeybee; invasive species	APIS-MELLIFERA; UNITED-STATES; BEE RACES; HISTORY; EXPANSIONS; ANCIENT	The Anthropocene is an epoch hallmarked by intensified human intrusion across ecosystems. One such intrusion is the movement and re-introduction of long-separated populations. By facilitating introgression - intraspecific genetic admixture - secondary contact can facilitate range expansion and the establishment of invasive species. The proximate mechanisms through which introgression facilitates expansion are rarely known (Bock et al., 2015; Rius & Darling, 2014), but managed species provide a useful avenue for exploration. Bee-keepers have been interbreeding highly diverged honeybee clades for centuries, often to introduce "useful" phenotypic variation to their stocks. Across the Western honeybee's (Apis mellifera) European range, this practice has not resulted in range expansion (Moritz, Hartel, & Neumann, 2005). In the Americas, however, introgression of European with African subspecies resulted in a widely publicized invasive population: The Africanized honeybee (AHB). In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Nelson, Wallberg, Simoes, Lawson, and Webster (2017) have made the first step towards understanding how this invasive species successfully spread across the Americas.

Whilst negative population trends within this functional group have understandably received much attention in recent decades, another facet of global changes has been overshadowed: species undergoing expansion. Here, we review the factors and traits that have allowed a fraction of the pollinating entomofauna to take advantage of global environmental change. Sufficient mobility, high resistance to acute heat stress, and inherent adaptation to warmer climates appear to be key traits that allow pollinators to persist and even expand in the face of climate change. An overall flexibility in dietary and nesting requirements is common in expanding species, although niche specialization can also drive expansion under specific contexts. The numerous consequences of wild and domesticated pollinator expansions, including competition for resources, pathogen spread, and hybridization with native wildlife, are also discussed. Overall, we show that the traits and factors involved in the success stories of expanding pollinators are mostly species specific and context dependent, rendering generalizations of 'winning traits' complicated. This work illustrates the increasing need to consider expansion and its numerous consequences as significant facets of global changes and encourages efforts to monitor the impacts of expanding insect pollinators, particularly exotic species, on natural ecosystems.

The fire ant species and hybrid status were determined using cuticular hydrocarbon and venom alkaloid indices obtained from gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Hybrids were the most common fire ant throughout Tennessee. With the exception of a few isolated S. invicta samples, only hybrids were found in east Tennessee, and hybrids predominated in middle Tennessee. In west Tennessee, mixed populations of S. richteri and hybrids were found. Hybrids were more common in west Tennessee than a survey performed a decade earlier. No statistical differences were detected in the average inter-colonial worker size of S. richteri and hybrids. Likewise, average worker size was not related to geographic location in Tennessee. The similarity in average worker size among hybrid colonies with a wide range of cuticular hydrocarbon and venom alkaloid values suggests introgression was not impacting ant size in colonies sampled throughout Tennessee.

The damselfly Ischnura elegans has recently expanded south into the range of its ecologically and morphologically similar sister species Ischnura graellsii. Molecular work shows ongoing introgression between these species, but the extent to which this species mixing is modulated by ecological niche use is not known. Here, we (1) conduct a detailed population genetic analysis based on molecular markers and (2) model the ecological niche use of both species in allopatric and sympatric regions. Population genetic analyses showed chronic introgression between I.elegans and I.graellsii across a wide part of Spain, and admixture analysis corroborated this, showing that the majority of I.elegans from the sympatric zone could not be assigned to either the I.elegans or I.graellsii species cluster. Niche modeling demonstrated that I.elegans has modified its environmental niche following hybridization and genetic introgression with I.graellsii, making niche space of introgressed I.elegans populations more similar to I.graellsii. Taken together, this corroborates the view that adaptive introgression has moved genes from I.graellsii into I.elegans and that this process is enabling Spanish I.elegans to occupy a novel niche, further facilitating its expansion. Our results add to the growing evidence that hybridization can play an important and creative role in the adaptive evolution of animals.

SIMULATING RANGE EXPANSION: MALE SPECIES RECOGNITION AND LOSS OF PREMATING ISOLATION IN DAMSELFLIES	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Calopteryx; environmental change; hybridization; male mate choice; premating isolation; reinforcement; sympatry	SEXUAL SELECTION; CALOPTERYX DAMSELFLIES; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; POPULATION DIVERGENCE; MATE CHOICE; ODONATA; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; REINFORCEMENT; CLIMATE	Prolonged periods of allopatry might result in loss of the ability to discriminate against other formerly sympatric species, and can lead to heterospecific matings and hybridization upon secondary contact. Loss of premating isolation during prolonged allopatry can operate in the opposite direction of reinforcement, but has until now been little explored. We investigated how premating isolation between two closely related damselfly species, Calopteryx splendens and C. virgo, might be affected by the expected future northward range expansion of C. splendens into the allopatric zone of C. virgo in northern Scandinavia. We simulated the expected secondary contact by presenting C. splendens females to C. virgo males in the northern allopatric populations in Finland. Premating isolation toward C. splendens in northern allopatric populations was compared to sympatric populations in southern Finland and southern Sweden. Male courtship responses of C. virgo toward conspecific females showed limited geographic variation, however, courtship attempts toward heterospecific C. splendens females increased significantly from sympatry to allopatry. Our results suggest that allopatric C. virgo males have partly lost their ability to discriminate against heterospecific females. Reduced premating isolation in allopatry might lead to increased heterospecific matings between taxa that are currently expanding and shifting their ranges in response to climate change.

By means of mitochondrial and nuclear markers and of Geometric Morphometrics applied to sexual appendages, we defined i) the geographical boundaries between the two species in Italy and ii) we determined the presence, the extent, and the genetic characteristics of the hybridization. Genetic data evidenced asymmetric hybridization with the males of C.trinacriae able to mate both interspecifically and intraspecifically. The results contrast with expectations under neutral gene introgression and sexual selection. This data, along with the morphological evidence of significant differences in size and shape of sexual appendages between the males of the two species, seem indicative of the role of mechanical constraints in intraspecific matings. The origin of the two species is dated about to 1.32 Mya and the hybridization resulted related to range expansion of the two species after Last Glacial Maximum and this led to the secondary contact between the two taxa in central Italy. At last, our results indicate that the range of C.trinacriae, a threatened and protected species, has been moving northward probably driven by climate changes. As a result, the latter species is currently intruding into the range of C.boltonii. The hybrid area is quite extended and the hybrids seem well adapted to the environment. From a conservation point of view, even if C.trinacriae has a strong genetic identity, the discovery of hybridization between the two species should be considered in a future species management.

We documented the distribution and spread of Africanized honey bees at 15 localities across Yucatan by sampling worker honey bees from more than 280 managed colonies per year from 1990 to 1994, and from over 60 feral colonies per year at the same localities from 1992 to 1994. Colonies were classified morphometrically, using the criteria of Rinderer et al (1993a) for managed colonies and using modified probablities for feral colonies. Africanized honey bees spread from the south, and by 1991 were found throughout Yucatan in managed colonies. By 1994, 52% of managed colonies were classified as pure Africanized and, assuming linearity in the rate of Africanization, all managed colonies are projected to be Africanized by mid-1997. Feral colonies showed evidence of Europeanization in 1992 but, by 1994, they were classified as Africanized. The slower pace of Africanization of managed colonies than that predicted for Yucatan may have arisen from extensive hybridization between the incoming Africanized honey bees and the large resident European honey bee population of the state, which contained among the highest densities of managed European colonies in the world before 1987. As yet, there is no evidence of a reduction in honey production in Yucatan.

Here, we used whole-genome sequence data to investigate the origin of the yellow hindwing bar in the Heliconius cydno radiation. We found modular variation associated with hindwing phenotype in two narrow noncoding regions upstream and downstream of the cortex gene, which was recently identified as a pigmentation pattern controller in multiple species of Heliconius. Genetic variation at each of these modules suggests an independent control of the dorsal and ventral hindwing patterning, with the upstream module associated with the ventral phenotype and the downstream module with the dorsal one. Furthermore, we detected introgression between H.cydno and its closely related species Heliconius melpomene in these modules, likely allowing both species to participate in novel mimicry rings. In sum, our findings support the role of regulatory modularity coupled with adaptive introgression as an elegant mechanism by which novel phenotypic combinations can evolve and fuel an adaptive radiation.

Recent eastward range expansion into stands of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and associated hybrids with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in western Canada has created concern that the insect will continue moving eastward. In the Great Lakes region, mountain pine beetle would encounter novel species of pines and associated insect fauna; interactions with which are largely unexplored. We baited logs of jack pine with lures for mountain pine beetle and Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) alone and in combination in a 2 x 2 factorial design in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Both insects occur in this region, but not jack pine, a common species in the Great Lakes region of North America at risk of invasion by mountain pine beetle. We measured attraction and reproduction of insects that colonized the logs. Ips grandicollis were significantly more attracted to logs of jack pine baited with their aggregation pheromone, ipsenol, than unbaited logs or those baited with pheromones of mountain pine beetle and myrcene, a host volatile. Colonization by I. grandicollis was inhibited by the presence of lures for mountain pine beetle. We also found larvae of longhorn borers, likely Monochamus spp., infesting logs. These borers, which act as competitors and facultative predators of bark beetles, were significantly attracted to logs baited with ipsenol over those baited with lures for mountain pine beetle. Our results suggest that if mountain pine beetle were to invade the Great Lakes Region, common bark and woodboring species such as I. grandicollis and longhorn borers would not compete with mountain pine beetles at tree-colonizing stages, and thus could pose little resistance to invasion.

Distribution and rapid range expansion of the introduced willow sawfly Nematus oligospilus Forster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) in Australasia	AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						dispersal; invasive species; Salix; species distribution; Tenthredinidae	NEW-ZEALAND; INVASIONS	The willow sawfly, Nematus oligospilus Forster (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), has been introduced inadvertently across temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, including New Zealand and Australia, where it has dispersed extremely rapidly. A host specialist herbivore, at high population densities it can defoliate and damage introduced willows (Salix spp.), many species of which are invasive weeds in Australasia. In this study, we show that in just 10 years, the distribution of N. oligospilus has expanded across most of south-eastern Australia and south-western Western Australia and, in less than 15 years across both the North and South Islands of New Zealand. The relative population density of N. oligospilus varied widely within both geographic regions. The distribution of N. oligospilus was still expanding in Australia where high densities resulted in widespread willow defoliation. In contrast, the distribution of the willow sawfly had reached fully across both the North and South Islands in New Zealand, but its density had declined from the early stage of invasion. All willow taxa surveyed were utilized by the willow sawfly, but host preferences were apparent, especially for the S. fragilis/S. x rubens hybrid complex. Many factors, including natural enemies, willow range expansion and environmental conditions are likely to affect the long-term population dynamics and spread of N. oligospilus in Australia.

Such insights help inform policy on invasive species and on impacts of climate change at regional and local scales. We used the CLIMEX model to infer the response of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), to temperature and moisture from its range in the United States. We tested hypotheses on the mechanisms that limit the distribution of the ant and estimated the potential global area at risk from invasion. The ant can spread further in the United States, including north along the west coast, where patterns of infestation will differ from those in the east. We analyzed the risk of colonization in Australia and New Zealand, where the ant was recently discovered. The patterns of infestation of the ant in Oceania will differ from those in the eastern United States, with slower growth and less winter mortality. This study adds to earlier temperature-based models by incorporating a moisture response; by replacing arbitrary categories of colony size to predict overwintering success with a site-specific model based on the balance between annual growth and survival; and by comparing different hypotheses on low temperature-related mechanisms that limit the geographical distribution. It shows how the response of a species to climate can be synthesized from field observations to provide useful insights into its population dynamics. Such analyses provide a basis for making decisions on regional management of invasive species and an informative context for local studies.

To better understand the fire ant species distribution in Tennessee, the state was divided into 16.1 x 16.1 km grids, and a single colony was sampled for cuticular hydrocarbon and venom alkaloid analyses within each grid. A total of 387 samples was processed from which 9 (2.3%), 167 (43.2%), and 211 (54.5%) were identified as red (Solenopsis invicta Buren), black (Solenopsis richteri Forel), or hybrid (S. invicta x S. richteri) imported fire ants, respectively. The S. invicta was only found near metropolitan Nashville in Davidson and Williamson counties and at one site in Decatur Co. All samples east of Franklin Co. were identified as hybrids. Tennessee counties west of Lincoln were predominantly S. richteri (86.5%) as opposed to hybrid (13.0%) and S. invicta (0.5%). The exception was Hardin Co., which was predominantly hybrid. Counties containing both hybrid and S. richteri (all in the middle and western part of the state) included Bedford, Decatur, Franklin, Giles, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Lawrence, Lincoln, Marshall, Maury, McNairy, Perry, and Wayne. The S. invicta samples collected from one Williamson Co. site were determined to be polygyne and infected with the Solenopsis invicta virus (genotype SINV-1A). This was the first detection of polygyne imported fire ant in Tennessee. The SINV-1A virus was also a new find at the time of detection, but has been previously reported. The survey results are being used to direct current and future biological control efforts against imported fire ants in Tennessee.

However, non-target species, such as cleaner fish used to remove sea lice from farmed fish, are rarely considered. Here, we report that wild corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops), which are transported long distances to be used as cleaner fish in salmon farms, escape and hybridize with local populations. Recently, increasing numbers of corkwing wrasse have been reported in Flatanger in Norway, north of its described distribution range, an area heavily relying on the import of cleaner fish from Skagerrak. Using genetic markers identified with 2bRAD sequencing, we show that, although the Flatanger population largely is a result of a northward range expansion, there is also evidence of considerable gene flow from southern populations in Skagerrak and Kattegat. Of the 40 corkwing wrasses sampled in Flatanger, we discovered two individuals with clear southern genotypes, one first generation hybrid, and 12 potential second-generation hybrids. In summary, we provide evidence that corkwing wrasse escape from fish farms and hybridize with local populations at the leading edge of an ongoing range expansion. Although the magnitude and significance of escapees warrant further investigation, these results should be taken into consideration in the use of translocated cleaner fish.

In recent years, the range of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) has expanded from lodgepole pine-dominated forests east of the Rocky Mountains into lodgepole x jack pine hybrid forest of western Alberta, and may soon invade jack pine forests of the boreal. Our understanding of factors contributing colonization of jack pine by mountain pine beetle is far from complete and several factors may limit its spread in these forests, including tree resistance and competitors. Among these, the jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus Freeman) is one of the most important insect enemies of jack pine and an outbreak defoliator that potentially weakens jack pine trees, which may make them more susceptible to MPB attacks. To develop effective management strategies in the face of the short-run impacts of climate change, we need an in-depth understanding of factors influencing establishment and survival of the beetle in jack pine forests.

Investigating these genetic patterns is important, as they may reveal obscured processes and players. The maternally inherited bacterium Wolbachia is among the most widespread symbionts in insects. Wolbachia typically spreads within host species by conferring direct fitness benefits, and/or by manipulating its host reproduction to favour infected over uninfected females. Under sufficient selective advantage, the mitochondrial haplotype associated with the favoured maternally-inherited symbiotic strains will spread (i.e. hitchhike), resulting in low mitochondrial genetic variation across the host species range. Method The common bluetail damselfly (Ischnura elegans: van der Linden, 1820) has recently emerged as a model organism for genetics and genomic signatures of range expansion during climate change. Although there is accumulating data on the consequences of such expansion on the genetics of I. elegans, no study has screened for Wolbachia in the damselfly genus Ischnura. Here, we present the biogeographic variation in Wolbachia prevalence and penetrance across Europe and Japan (including samples from 17 populations), and from close relatives in the Mediterranean area (i.e. I. genei: Rambur, 1842; and I. saharensis: Aguesse, 1958). Results Our data reveal (a) multiple Wolbachia-strains, (b) potential transfer of the symbiont through hybridization, (c) higher infection rates at higher latitudes, and (d) reduced mitochondrial diversity in the north-west populations, indicative of hitchhiking associated with the selective sweep of the most common strain. We found low mitochondrial haplotype diversity in the Wolbachia-infected north-western European populations (Sweden, Scotland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Italy) of I. elegans, and, conversely, higher mitochondrial diversity in populations with low penetrance of Wolbachia (Ukraine, Greece, Montenegro and Cyprus). The timing of the selective sweep associated with infected lineages was estimated between 20,000 and 44,000 years before present, which is consistent with the end of the last glacial period about 20,000 years. Conclusions Our findings provide an example of how endosymbiont infections can shape spatial variation in their host evolutionary genetics during postglacial expansion. These results also challenge population genetic studies that do not consider the prevalence of symbionts in many insects, which we show can impact geographic patterns of mitochondrial genetic diversity.

Undergoing range expansion insects can face a change in the local photoperiod to which they need to resynchronize. Rapid range expansion can be associated with rapid photoperiodic adaptation, which can be associated with intense selection on strongly heritable polygenic traits. Alternatively, it is proposed that, in insects with an XO sex-determination system, genes with large effect residing on the sex chromosome could drive photoperiodic adaptation because the gene or genes are exposed to selection in the sex carrying only a single X-chromosome. The present study seeks to understand which of these alternatives more likely explains the rapid photoperiodic adaptation in European Colorado potato beetles Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say. Diapause induction is assessed in beetles from a northern and a southern population, as well as from reciprocal hybrid crosses between the northern and southern population, when reared at an intermediate length photoperiod. The crosses within population display the expected responses, with the northern and southern populations showing high and low diapause propensity, respectively. The hybrids show intermediate responses in all studied traits. No clear difference in the responses in hybrids depending on the latitudinal origin of their father or mother is detected, even though partial paternal line dominance is seen in the responses of male beetles in one hybrid cross. These results therefore indicate that, in L. decemlineata, photoperiodic diapause induction is strongly heritable, and has an additive polygenic autosomal background.

While intuitively appealing, the hypothesis has two implicit assumptions: that phenotypic gaps between potential hosts limit host range, and that characters controlling host use are additively inherited in plant hybrids. Evaluation of these assumptions suggests that operation of the hybrid bridge hypothesis is relatively uncommon. In addition, the hypothesis has not been well integrated into existing theoretical and empirical work on the evolution of host range in herbivorous insects. Proper evaluation of the hypothesis will require information on the effect of plant hybridization on both insect preference and insect performance. Ecological and genetic factors affecting range expansion in both hybrids and novel parents also require evaluation.

Climate change induced hybridization in flying squirrels	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate warming; distribution; Glaucomys sabrinus; Glaucomys volans; global change; range expansion	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; CONSERVATION GENETICS; GLAUCOMYS-SABRINUS; STRONGYLOIDES-ROBUSTUS; HYBRID ZONE; VOLANS; MICROSATELLITE; INTROGRESSION; MITOCHONDRIAL; DYNAMICS	There is now unequivocal evidence for global climate change; however, its potential impacts on evolutionary processes remain unclear. Many species have responded to contemporary climate change through shifts in their geographic range. This could lead to increased sympatry between recently diverged species; likely increasing the potential for hybridization. Recently, following a series of warm winters, southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) in Ontario, Canada rapidly expanded their northern range limit resulting in increased sympatry with the closely related northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). This provided the opportunity to test the prediction that contemporary climate change can act as a catalyst creating conditions for the formation of hybrid zones. Following extensive sampling and molecular analyses (nuclear and mitochondrial DNA), we identified the occurrence of hybridization between sympatric G. sabrinus and G. volans. There was evidence of backcrossing but not of extensive introgession, consistent with the hypothesis of recent rather than historic hybridization.

The subspecies A. m. scutellata originated in Africa and was introduced to the Americas in 1956. For the last 60 years, it hybridized successfully with European subspecies, previous residents in the area. The result of this hybridization was called Africanized honey bee (AHB). AHB has spread since then, arriving to Puerto Rico (PR) in 1994. The honey bee population on the island acquired a mosaic of features from AHB or the European honey bee (EHB). AHB in Puerto Rico shows a major distinctive characteristic, docile behavior, and is called gentle Africanized honey bees (gAHB). We used 917 SNPs to examine the population structure, genetic differentiation, origin, and history of range expansion and colonization of gAHB in PR. We compared gAHB to populations that span the current distribution of A. mellifera worldwide. The gAHB population is shown to be a single population that differs genetically from the examined populations of AHB. Texas and PR groups are the closest genetically. Our results support the hypothesis that the Texas AHB population is the source of gAHB in Puerto Rico.

Regional divergence and mosaic spatial distribution of two closely related damselfly species (Enallagma hageni and Enallagma ebrium)	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						amplified fragment length polymorphism; distribution; local divergence; Odonata; patch; radiation; speciation	MULTILOCUS GENOTYPE DATA; LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL; REPRODUCTIVE INTERFERENCE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; MORPHOLOGICAL EVOLUTION; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; GENETIC CONSEQUENCES; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; SEXUAL SELECTION; RANGE EXPANSION	North American Enallagma damselflies radiated during the Pleistocene, and species differ mainly by reproductive structures. Although morphologically very different, Enallagma hageni and Enallagma ebrium are genetically very similar. Partitioning of genetic variation (AFLP), isolation by distance and clustering analyses indicate that these morphospecies are locally differentiated genetically. Spatial analyses show that they are rarely sympatric at local sites, and their distributions form a mosaic of patches where one is clearly dominant over hundreds of square kilometers. However, these morphospecies are also not genetically more similar when they are sympatric, indicating that hybridization is probably not occurring. Given that these morphospecies are ecologically equivalent, strong assortative mating, reproductive interference and fast post-glacial recolonization may explain the origin and maintenance of these distributional patches across eastern North America. By limiting opportunities for gene flow, reproductive interference may play an unsuspected role in accelerating genetic differentiation in the early phases of nonecological speciation.

To assess the possible risks from their habitats overlapping, we investigated the potential for hybridization and the development of F1 individuals. We observed successful mating of the two sibling species under artificial conditions. The presence of a postzygotic hybridization barrier was supported by the delay of larval development only in females; a delay did not occur in males. Existence of the barrier was also supported by a decreased egg hatching rate in one brood; this was likely associated with infection with Wolbachia, a bacterium manipulating the reproductive capability of its host. The size and wing markings of F1 hybrid individuals were intermediate between those of the two species. These results suggest that, if Z. emelina and Z. otis are distributed sympatrically in the future, there is a possibility of introgression and reproductive interference between the two species, which would increase the risk of decline of each species.

Differential effects of short term winter thermal stress on diapausing tiger swallowtail butterflies (Papilio spp.)	INSECT SCIENCE			English	Article						climate change; developmental threshold; incipient hybrid species; metabolic cost; Papilionidae; post-diapause delays; thermal stress	SEX-LINKED DIAPAUSE; COLD TOLERANCE; HYBRID ZONE; RANGE EXPANSION; FLESH FLIES; GLAUCUS; CANADENSIS; TEMPERATURES; LEPIDOPTERA; SPECIATION	It is generally thought that insects inhabiting lower latitudes are more severely impacted by changes in their thermal environment than are high latitude species. This is attributed to the wider range of temperatures to which high-latitude species are exposed. By contrast, low-latitude species have typically evolved in more thermally stable environments with a narrower range of temperature variation. However, deviation from this pattern can occur and here we report that under variable winter conditions a higher latitude species may be more sensitive to thermal variation than its lower latitude sister species. Using split broods, we examined the survival and adult emergence success of diapausing pupae of Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus, as well as a unique, recombinant hybrid population (late-flight) to short periods of mid-winter cold and heat stress. Our results indicate that the higher latitude, univoltine populations (P. canadensis and late-flights) exhibit lower pupal survival than the lower latitude, facultative diapauser (P. glaucus) for all mid-winter thermal stress treatments, both high and low. Size differences alone do not appear to account for the observed differences in survival or metabolic costs in these three phenotypes, as late-flight individuals are similar in size to P. glaucus. We attribute the observed differences in survival and weight loss to potential metabolic differences and variation in the intensity of diapause, in addition to divergent adaptation to winter precipitation levels (e.g. snow cover) and the influences this may have on microhabitat temperature moderation.

Kirk; Hsu, Yu-Feng			Restoration of an endangered plant, Hygrophila pogonocalyx, leads to an adaptive host shift of the chocolate pansy (Junonia iphita iphita)	ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Host preference; Host specialization; Larvae growth; Larvae survivorship; Range expansion	OVIPOSITION PREFERENCE; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; LARVAL PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTIONARY; INSECT; RACES; BUTTERFLIES; DRIVEN; METAPOPULATION; ASSOCIATION	Anthropogenic introduction of a plant species may cause novel encounters between the plant and local herbivores, and initiate evolutionary changes in host plant usage by herbivores. Until recently the endemic aquatic plant Hygrophila pogonocalyx was endangered and had a restricted distribution in Taiwan. Massive restoration efforts since 1997 have led to an expansion of the plant's distribution and a novel encounter between it and an Asian butterfly, the chocolate pansy, Junonia iphita (Nymphalidae). This butterfly appears to have colonized H. pogonocalyx, switching from its original host, Strobilanthes penstemonoides var. formosana. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether the utilization of H. pogonocalyx as a host plant has initiated a differentiation between butterflies using the novel and the original hosts. To this purpose we collected butterflies from patches of the two host plants which grow sympatrically. We tested oviposition preference for the two hosts and larval performance on them. Female adults exhibited distinct oviposition preference toward the host plant their mothers preferred. Offspring showed greater survivorship and pupal weight when fed on the host plant their mothers preferred. Male adults displayed territorial behaviors on the host plant that their mothers had preferred. Finally, the survival rate of offspring produced from cross-mating between individuals with different host plant preference was lower than that of non-hybrids. Taken together, we suggest that genetic differentiation has occurred between individuals preferring H,pogonocalyx versus S. penstemonoides as host plants via host shifting. This process was likely induced by the mass restoration of the formerly rare and endangered plant species. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Tan, Wen-Hao; Lin, Y.

Global climate change impacts drought frequency and severity and is implicated in the range expansion of the mountain pine beetle into formerly unsuitable habitats. Its expanded range has recently reached the lodgepole x jack pine hybrid zone in central Alberta, Canada, which could act as a transition from its historical lodgepole pine host to a jack pine host present in the boreal forest. This field study tested the effects of water limitation on chemical defenses of mature trees against mountain pine beetle-associated microorganisms and on beetle brood success in lodgepole x jack pine hybrid trees. Tree chemical defenses as measured by monoterpene emission from tree boles and monoterpene concentration in needles were greater in trees that experienced water deficit compared to well-watered trees. Myrcene was identified as specific defensive compound, since it significantly increased upon inoculation with dead mountain pine beetles. Beetles reared in bolts from trees that experienced water deficit emerged with a higher fat content, demonstrating for the first time experimentally that drought conditions benefit mountain pine beetles. Further, our study demonstrated that volatile chemical emission from tree boles and phloem chemistry place the hybrid tree chemotype in-between lodgepole pine and jack pine, which might facilitate the host shift from lodgepole pine to jack pine.

Selection of entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes) for the biocontrol of Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) in Western Canada	APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Mountain pine beetle; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Forest entomology; Entomopathogens; Beauveria bassiana; Microbial biocontrol agents	MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE; TARNISHED PLANT BUG; SPRUCE BARK BEETLE; METARHIZIUM-ANISOPLIAE; RANGE EXPANSION; VIRULENCE; HYMENOPTERA; OOSPOREIN; PIGMENTS; BIOSYNTHESIS	The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, has infested over similar to 16 Mha of pine forests in British Columbia killing >50% of mature lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, trees in affected stands. At present, it is functionally an invasive species in Alberta, killing and reproducing in evolutionarily naive populations of lodgepole pine (P. contorta), novel jack pine (P. banksiana), and their hybrids. The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has shown some potential as a biocontrol agent of several bark beetle species. In this study, nine isolates of B. bassiana were examined for insect virulence characteristics, including conidiation rate, pigmentation, and infection rate in laboratory-reared D. ponderosae, to assess for their potential as biocontrol agents. The strains were categorized into three phenotypic groups based on pigmentation, conidial density, and myceliation rate. Virulence screening utilizing insect-based agar medium (D. ponderosae and European honeybee Apis mellifera carcasses) revealed no difference in selection of fungal growth. However, infection studies on D. ponderosae and A. mellifera showed contrasting results. In vivo A. mellifera infection model revealed similar to 5% mortality, representing the natural death rate of the hive population, whereas laboratory-reared D. ponderosae showed 100% mortality and mycosis. The LT50 (median lethal time 50) ranges from 2 to 5 +/- 0.33 days, and LT100 ranges from 4 to 6 +/- 0.5 days. We discuss the selective advantages of the three phenotypic groups in terms of virulence, pigmentation, conidial abundance, and tolerance to abiotic factors like UV and host tree monoterpenes. These results can further provide insights into the development of several phenotypically diverse B. bassiana strains in controlling the spread of the invasive D. ponderosae in Western Canada.

Yucatan honey bee populations now include many colonies with intermediate morphologies. Genotypes of mitochondria have disassociated from historically correlated Africanized or European morphology, producing diverse phenotypic associations. This suggests that the size of resident European populations may be important in explaining previously reported asymmetrical hybridization. Evidence of natural hybridization is encouraging for the use of genetic management to mitigate the effects of Africanized bees in the United States.

Spatial genetic structure of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreak in western Canada: historical patterns and contemporary dispersal	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Review						bark beetle; dispersal; mountain pine beetle; population genetics; population structure; Scolytinae	LODGEPOLE PINE; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; RANGE EXPANSION; BARK BEETLE; POSTGLACIAL COLONIZATION; HOPKINS COLEOPTERA; TOMICUS-DESTRUENS; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE	Environmental change has a wide range of ecological consequences, including species extinction and range expansion. Many studies have shown that insect species respond rapidly to climatic change. A mountain pine beetle epidemic of record size in North America has led to unprecedented mortality of lodgepole pine, and a significant range expansion to the northeast of its historic range. Our goal was to determine the spatial genetic variation found among outbreak population from which genetic structure, and dispersal patterns may be inferred. Beetles from 49 sampling locations throughout the outbreak area in western Canada were analysed at 13 microsatellite loci. We found significant north-south population structure as evidenced by: (i) Bayesian-based analyses, (ii) north-south genetic relationships and diversity gradients; and (iii) a lack of isolation-by-distance in the northernmost cluster. The north-south structure is proposed to have arisen from the processes of postglacial colonization as well as recent climate-driven changes in population dynamics. Our data support the hypothesis of multiple sources of origin for the outbreak and point to the need for population specific information to improve our understanding and management of outbreaks. The recent range expansion across the Rocky Mountains into the jack/lodgepole hybrid and pure jack pine zones of northern Alberta is consistent with a northern British Columbia origin. We detected no loss of genetic variability in these populations, indicating that the evolutionary potential of mountain pine beetle to adapt has not been reduced by founder events. This study illustrates a rapid range-wide response to the removal of climatic constraints, and the potential for range expansion of a regional population.	[Samarasekera, G. D. N.

Phylogeography of Pogonomyrmex barbatus and P.rugosus harvester ants with genetic and environmental caste determination	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Mitochondrial DNA; North American deserts; phylogeography; Pogonomyrmex	DEPENDENT LINEAGE SYSTEM; DNA-SEQUENCE DATA; SPECIES GROUP; HISTORICAL BIOGEOGRAPHY; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; CRYPTIC VICARIANCE; NEOGENE VICARIANCE; POPULATION-GROWTH; HYBRID ORIGIN; NORTH-AMERICA	We present a phylogeographic study of at least six reproductively isolated lineages of new world harvester ants within the Pogonomyrmex barbatus and P.rugosus species group. The genetic and geographic relationships within this clade are complex: Four of the identified lineages show genetic caste determination (GCD) and are divided into two pairs. Each pair has evolved under a mutualistic system that necessitates sympatry. These paired lineages are dependent upon one another because their GCD requires interlineage matings for the production of F1 hybrid workers, and intralineage matings are required to produce queens. This GCD system maintains genetic isolation among these interdependent lineages, while simultaneously requiring co-expansion and emigration as their distributions have changed over time. It has also been demonstrated that three of these four GCD lineages have undergone historical hybridization, but the narrower sampling range of previous studies has left questions on the hybrid parentage, breadth, and age of these groups. Thus, reconstructing the phylogenetic and geographic history of this group allows us to evaluate past insights and hypotheses and to plan future inquiries in a more complete historical biogeographic context. Using mitochondrial DNA sequences sampled across most of the morphospecies' ranges in the U.S.A. and Mexico, we conducted a detailed phylogeographic study. Remarkably, our results indicate that one of the GCD lineage pairs has experienced a dramatic range expansion, despite the genetic load and fitness costs of the GCD system. Our analyses also reveal a complex pattern of vicariance and dispersal in Pogonomyrmex harvester ants that is largely concordant with models of late Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene range shifts among various arid-adapted taxa in North America.

J	Walker, P; Leather, SR; Crawley, MJ				Walker, P; Leather, SR; Crawley, MJ			Differential rates of invasion in three related alien oak gall wasps (Cynipidae : Hymenoptera)	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Review						alien species; biological invasions; cynipid oak gall wasps; Quercus; range expansion	POPULATION BIOLOGY; RANGE EXPANSION; PARASITOIDS; ABUNDANCE; RICHNESS	Three related species of oak gall wasps, Andricus corruptrix (Schlechtendal), A. kollari (Hartig) and A. lignicola (Hartig) have entered Britain since the introduction of Turkey oak, Quercus cerris L. in 1735. Their lifecycles involve alternating generations between an agamic generation on the native oak species (Q. petraea, Q. robur and their hybrid Q. x. rosacea), and a smaller, sexual generation on the alien Q. cerris. In examining the distributions of these insects and Q. cerris, we hypothesized that: (1) the invasion will spread more rapidly in places where both host trees are equally abundant than through regions where one of the tree species is substantially less common than the other; (2) interspecific competition between these bud-galling species will lead to a negative correlation between their abundances at a particular site; (3) differential recruitment of natural enemies from the native hymenopteran fauna will slow the rate of spread in a species-specific manner. A. kollari arrived nearly 200 years ago and is now found throughout the British Isles, wherever Turkey oak is grown. A. lignicola and A. corruptrix have been here for 30 years, after establishing in S. E. England. A. lignicola is in its final rapid stages of range expansion across England, southern Scotland and N.E. Scotland. A. corruptrix is just beginning to spread through Central and S. W. England. It has occupied proportionally fewer sites behind its invasion front than have the other two species, but is no less abundant at these sites. Nevertheless, distance leaps of up to 50 km were identified in A. lignicola in N.E. Scotland, and the possibility of long-distance transport of infected trees through the horticulture and forestry trades remains. The co-occurrence of mature individuals of both host Quercus species does appear to have increased their rates of colonization in A. lignicola and A. corruptrix. There is no evidence, however, to suggest that interspecific competition between the three alien gall formers is an important factor in determining their distributions and abundance within their invaded ranges. All three species have recruited parasitoids and inquilines rapidly from the native fauna; attack rates were highly variable, but showed no evidence of density dependence across sites.

Comparative Cutaneous Water Loss and Desiccation Tolerance of FourSolenopsisspp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in the Southeastern United States	INSECTS			English	Article						cuticular permeability; desiccation resistance; Solenopsis invicta; Solenopsis richteri; Solenopsis invictaxS; richteri; Solenopsis geminata; distribution	IMPORTED FIRE ANT; SOLENOPSIS-INVICTA HYMENOPTERA; RANGE EXPANSION; TEMPERATURE; HYBRID; RESISTANCE; LEPIDOPTERA; POPULATIONS; REDUCTION; INFLUENZA	The high surface area to volume ratio of terrestrial insects makes them highly susceptible to desiccation mainly through the cuticle. Cuticular permeability (CP) is usually the most important factor limiting water loss in terrestrial insects. Water loss rate, percentage of total body water (%TBW) content, CP, and desiccation tolerance were investigated in workers of fourSolenopsisspecies in the southeastern USA. We hypothesized that tropical/subtropical ants (S.invictaandS.geminata) will have lower CP values and tolerate higher levels of desiccation than temperate ants (S.richteriandS. invictaxS.richteri). The %TBW content was similar among species.Solenopsis invictahad a 1.3-fold and 1.1-fold lower CP value thanS. invictaxS. richteriandS. richteri, respectively.Solenopsis geminatahad a 1.3-fold lower CP value thanS.invictaxS.richteri, and a 1.2-fold lower CP value thanS.richteri. The LT(50)values (lethal time to kill 50% of the population) ranged from 1.5 h (smallS. geminata) to 8.5 h (largeS. invicta). Desiccation tolerance ranged between 36 and 50 %TBW lost at death and was not related to a species' location of origin. This study is the first report of water relations ofS. invictaxS. richteri. It demonstrates that desiccation stress differentially can affect the survival of differentSolenopsisspecies and implies that environmental stress can affect the distribution of these species in the southeastern USA.

Out of the forest: past and present range expansion of a parthenogenetic weevil pest, or how to colonize the world successfully	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Ecological niche modeling; invasive weevils; Naupactus cervinus; parthenogenesis; Pleistocene refugia; range expansion	LATE PLEISTOCENE-HOLOCENE; FULLERS ROSE WEEVIL; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; NAUPACTUS-CERVINUS; REPRODUCTIVE MODE; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SOUTH-AMERICA; DAPHNIA-PULEX; PLATA BASIN; ARGENTINA	Previous research revealed complex diversification patterns in the parthenogenetic weevil Naupactus cervinus. To understand the origin of clonal diversity and successful spreading of this weevil, we investigated its geographic origin and possible dispersal routes and whether parthenogens can persist in habitats under unsuitable environmental conditions. This study is based on samples taken throughout a broad area of the species' range. We used both mitochondrial and nuclear markers and applied phylogenetic and network analyses to infer possible relationships between haplotypes. Bayesian phylogeographic analyses and ecological niche modeling were used to investigate the processes that shaped genetic diversity and enabled the colonization of new geographic areas. Southeastern Brazil emerges as the original distribution area of N. cervinus. We detected two range expansions, one along natural corridors during the Pleistocene and the other in countries outside South America during recent times. Isolation due to climate shifts during the early Pleistocene led to diversification in two divergent clades, which probably survived in different refugia of the Paranaense Forest and the Parana River delta. The origin of the clonal diversity was probably a complex process including mutational diversification, hybridization, and secondary colonization. The establishment of N. cervinus in areas outside its native range may indicate adaptation to drier and cooler conditions. Parthenogenesis would be advantageous for the colonization of new environments by preventing the breakup of successful gene combinations. As in other insect pests, the present distribution of N. cervinus results from both its evolutionary history and its recent history related to human activities.

This invasion signifies a climate change-induced range expansion by a native insect. The mechanism underlying this invasion is unknown, but likely involves phytochemicals that play critical roles in MPB biology. Thus far, studies have investigated the compatibility of jack pine chemistry with beetles and their microbial symbionts. I have identified three phytochemical mechanisms that have likely facilitated the host range expansion of MPB. First, jack pine chemistry is overall similar to that of the historical hosts of MPB. In particular, jack pine chemistry is compatible with beetle pheromone production, aggregation on host trees and larval development. Furthermore, the compatibility of jack pine chemistry maintains beneficial interactions between MPB and its microbial symbionts. Second, compared with historical hosts, the novel host not only has lower concentrations of toxic and repellent defense chemicals, but also contains large concentrations of chemicals promoting host colonization by MPB. These patterns are especially pronounced when comparing novel hosts with well-defended historical hosts. Finally, before MPBs arrived in jack pine forests, they invaded a zone of hybrids of novel and historical hosts that likely improved beetle success on jack pine, as hybrids show chemical characteristics of both hosts. In conclusion, the phytochemistry of jack pine has likely facilitated the biological invasion of this novel host by MPB.

Comparisons of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) reproduction within a novel and traditional host: effects of insect natal history, colonized host species and competitors	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Dendroctonus ponderosae; host breadth; host fidelity; interspecific competition; mountain pine beetle; natal effects; novel host; reproduction	2 FUNGAL SYMBIONTS; BARK BEETLES; IPS-PINI; RANGE EXPANSION; PHEROMONE PRODUCTION; INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS; QUANTITATIVE VARIATION; PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS; MYCANGIAL FUNGI; NATURAL ENEMIES	1 During host-breadth expansion, phytophagous insects incur risk from potentially deleterious novel host environments at the same time as potentially securing a potential escape in space or time from competing species. 2 Bark beetles reproduce under the bark of stems and branches of mature, stressed or moribund trees, and may suffer high mortality from plant defences and inter- and intraspecific competition. 3 An epidemic of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in western Canada has extended to over 18.1 million hectares of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex. Loudon) forests. 4 In some areas, mountain pine beetles have been found to reproduce within interior hybrid spruces [Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x engelmannii Parry ex. Engelmann], a normally rare occurrence. 5 Using mountain pine beetles reared from naturally-infested interior hybrid spruce and lodgepole pine hosts, we examined the effect of female natal species and colonized host species on the ability to attract mates and reproduce within spruce and pine logs deployed as a choice assay in a field setting. Additionally, we examined whether the arrival and reproduction of competitors such as pine engravers (Ips spp.) was associated with reduced brood production. 6 Females reared from pine and spruce exhibited similar reproductive potentials. Recruitment and establishment of ovipositional galleries, larval galleries and pupal chambers were similar in the typical and novel hosts. 7 Reproduction by mountain pine beetles in spruce, although successful, was significantly lower than in pine. This reduction occurred despite spruce logs being almost entirely free of competing secondary beetles.	[McKee, Fraser R.; Huber, Dezene P.

Complex inheritance of larval adaptation in Plutella xylostella to a novel host plant	HEREDITY			English	Article						host range expansion; diamondback moth; AFLP analysis; linkage mapping; inheritance	BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS; DIAMONDBACK MOTH; GENETIC-BASIS; OVIPOSITION PREFERENCE; ECOLOGICAL GENETICS; RANGE EVOLUTION; RESISTANCE; LEPIDOPTERA; INSECTS; LINKAGE	Studying the genetics of host shifts and range expansions in phytophagous insects contributes to our understanding of the evolution of host plant adaptation. We investigated the recent host range expansion to pea, in the pea-adapted strain (P-strain) of the crucifer-specialist diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). Larval survivorship on the novel host plant pea and a typical crucifer host (kale) was measured in reciprocal F-1, F-2 and backcrosses between the P-strain and a strain reared only on crucifers (C-strain). Reciprocal F-1 hybrids differed: offspring from P-strain mothers survived better on pea, indicating a maternal effect. However, no evidence for sex-linkage was found. Backcrosses to the P-strain produced higher survivorship on pea than C-strain backcrosses, suggesting recessive inheritance. In a linkage analysis with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers using P-strain backcrosses, two, four and five linkage groups contributing to survival on pea were identified in three different families respectively, indicating oligogenic inheritance. Thus, the newly evolved ability to survive on pea has a complex genetic basis, and the P-strain is still genetically heterogeneous and not yet fixed for all the alleles enabling it to survive on pea. Survivorship on kale was variable, but not related to survivorship on pea. This pattern may characterize the genetic inheritance of early host plant adaptation in oligophagous insect species.

Genetic population structure and hybridization in two sibling species, Tomoplagia reticulata and Tomoplagia pallens (Diptera: Tephritidae)	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Allozymes; Asteraceae; Campo rupestre; Cerrado; Eremanthus glomerulatus; mtDNA	APPLE MAGGOT FLY; RHAGOLETIS-POMONELLA; INTEGRATED SOFTWARE; BEETLE; COLEOPTERA; LANDSCAPE; SEQUENCES; NUMBER	Tomoplagia reticulata and T. pallens are sibling species that are specialists on Eremanthus glomerulatus. Besides adult terminalia, they show slight morphological differences and distinct geographic distributions. Once, however, they were found sympatrically. Using data from allozyme and mtDNA, we examined patterns of intra- and interspecific genetic structure, and investigated the possible occurrence of gene flow between them. Both species showed low diversity and high genetic structure, which can be linked to their high degree of specialization. Larval development occurs within flower heads, tissues that are available only during a short period of the year. Afterward, as they do not hibernate, they probably suffer a great reduction in population size, which leads to low genetic diversity. As monophagous insects, their population structure may correspond to the fragmented distribution of E. glomerulatus, which could isolate fly populations and increase inbreeding within them. One population exhibited a mixed genetic composition, compatible with one hybridization season when species were sympatric. This hybridization seems to be a rare event, due to T. pallens unusual range expansion.	[Abreu, A. G.; Solferini, V.

The factors promoting the formation of these processes are multiples but poorly explored in a biogeographical and ecological context. In the southeast coastal plain of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a hybrid zone was described between two closely related cactophilic species, Drosophila antonietae and D. serido. Here, we revisited and analysed specimens from this hybrid zone to evaluate its temporal and spatial dynamic. We examined allopatric and sympatric populations of the flies using independent sources of data such as mitochondrial and nuclear sequences, microsatellite loci, morphometrics of wings and male genitalia, and climatic niche models. We also verified the emergence of the flies from necrotic tissues of collected cacti to verify the role of host association for the population dynamics. Our results support the existence of a hybrid zone due to secondary contact and limited to the localities where the two species are currently in contact. Furthermore, we detected asymmetric bidirectional introgression and the maintenance of the species integrity, ecological association and morphological characters, suggesting selection and limited introgression. Considering our paleomodels, probably this hybrid zone is recent and the contact occurred during the Holocene to the present day, favoured by range expansion of their populations due to expansion of open and dry areas in eastern South America during palaeoclimatic and geomorphological events.

Effects of introgression on the genetic population structure of two ecologically and economically important conifer species: lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana)	GENOME			English	Article						genomics; introgression; Pinus banksiana; Pinus contorta; population genetics	MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA MINISATELLITE; RANGE EXPANSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIFFERENTIAL INTROGRESSION; SSP LATIFOLIA; SNP DETECTION; BEETLE; ADAPTATION; GENOME; FOREST	Forest trees exhibit a remarkable range of adaptations to their environment, but as a result of frequent and long-distance gene flow, populations are often only weakly differentiated. Lodgepole and jack pine hybridize in western Canada, which adds the opportunity for introgression through hybridization to contribute to population structure and (or) adaptive variation. Access to large sample size, high density SNP datasets for these species would improve our ability to resolve population structure, parameterize introgression, and separate the influence of demography from adaptation. To accomplish this, 454 transcriptome reads for lodgepole and jack pine were assembled using Newbler and MIRA, the assemblies mined for SNPs, and 1536 SNPs were selected for typing on lodgepole pine, jack pine, and their hybrids (N = 536). We identified population structure using both Bayesian clustering and discriminate analysis of principle components. Introgressed SNP loci were identified and their influence on observed population structure was assessed. We found that introgressed loci resulted in increased differentiation both within lodgepole and jack pine populations. These findings are timely given the recent mountain pine beetle population expansion in the hybrid zone, and will facilitate future studies of adaptive traits in these ecologically important species.

While many cases of adaptive trait introgression have been proposed, the relevant traits have rarely been identified, resulting in a lack of clear examples of this process. Here, we examine a purported case of adaptive introgression in which the annual sunflower Helianthus annuus annuus has captured alleles from a congener ( Helianthus debilis) to form a stabilized hybrid, Helianthus annuus texanus. We tested the hypotheses that herbivore resistance traits have introgressed from H. debilis to H. annuus and have increased adaptation in the latter. In two common gardens, fitness ( estimated by seed production) was on average 55% higher in H. a. texanus than in H. a. annuus. For H. a. texanus, three damage traits ( of seven tested) differed significantly from the H. a. annuus parent in one or both sites and were shifted in the direction of the more resistant H. debilis. Natural selection favored H. a. debilis BC 1 hybrids ( synthesized to mimic the ancestors of H. a. texanus) with H. debilis - like resistance to seed midges Neolasioptera helianthis and to receptacle/seed feeding Lepidoptera at one or both sites. Assuming similar herbivore pressures in the past, these results suggest that introgression of biotic resistance traits was important in the adaptation of H. annuus to central and southern Texas.

The leading edge has reached Alberta where forest composition shifts from lodgepole to jack pine through a hybrid zone. The susceptibility of jack pine to MPB is a major concern, but there has been no evidence of host-range expansion, in part due to the difficulty in distinguishing the parentals and their hybrids. We tested the utility of a panel of microsatellite loci optimized for both species to classify lodgepole pine, jack pine and their hybrids using simulated data. We were able to accurately classify simulated individuals, and hence applied these markers to identify the ancestry of attacked trees. Here we show for the first time successful MPB attack in natural jack pine stands at the leading edge of the epidemic. This once unsuitable habitat is now a novel environment for MPB to exploit, a potential risk which could be exacerbated by further climate change. The consequences of host-range expansion for the vast boreal ecosystem could be significant.	[Cullingham, Catherine I.; Cooke, Janice E.

We used environmental modelling, morphometric and genetic data to interpret ecological responses at the species boundary of a pair of New Zealand grasshoppers with very different ranges; one widespread (Phaulacridium marginale) and one restricted to semi-arid central/southern South Island (Phaulacridiumotagoense). Climate- and habitat-based distribution models for grasshoppers in the past (last glacial maximum), present and future (2070), in concert with modelling of vegetation patterns imply range and demographic expansion of P.marginale and stability of P.otagoense. mtDNA sequence revealed four main lineages with pronounced differences in genetic diversity and geographical range. The widespread lineage associated with P.marginale revealed a signature of range expansion but regionally restricted lineages were geographically structured at a fine scale. Within the narrow geographical range of P.otagoense, three mtDNA lineages resulted in high diversity, more typical of large stable populations. Geometric analysis of pronotum shape identified individuals from a region of sympatry with mixed characteristics. Mismatch of phenotype, mtDNA lineage and nuclear DNA sequence indicates introgression between grasshopper species now in contact. This appears to be accompanied by P.otagoense range reduction through ecological competition. Deforestation by people starting approximate to 800years ago best explains range change and resulting hybridisation of these grasshoppers. Anthropogenic habitat modification can have indirect consequences on insect biodiversity and conservation by enabling introgression between formerly separate populations and species.

BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						allozyme electrophoresis; biogeography; genetic diversity; ice age; phylogeography; postglacial range expansion	POLYOMMATUS-CORIDON LEPIDOPTERA; POSTGLACIAL COLONIZATION; EUROPEAN BUTTERFLIES; ALLOZYME VARIATION; FAUNAL STRUCTURES; ICE AGES; DIFFERENTIATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; LYCAENIDAE; REFUGIA	Phylogeographical studies are available for a considerable number of European species, but few analyses exist for temperate species with very large and fairly continuous populations that are also absent from Northern Europe. Therefore, we studied the butterfly Maniola jurtina as a model for this group. The species has two major genetic lineages (mean genetic distance between lineages: 0.033; F-CT: 0.052), most probably evolving in glacial differentiation centres in the western and eastern Mediterranean. The onset of this differentiation might have been the beginning of the last glacial stage maximum some 40 kyr BP. A hybrid zone between these two lineages exists in western Central Europe. No genetic substructures have been found within the two lineages (F-SC: 0.017) and average genetic distances are very small. Therefore, it is highly probable that postglacial expansion was of the phalanx type. There is, at most, very limited differentiation at regional and local scales. However, the genetic diversity within populations is high (means: A: 2.68; H-E: 17.2%; P: 78%), as would be predicted for such a common species. Comparison of these results with a published allozyme analysis revealed a similar phylogeographical pattern, but lower genetic diversity in the latter. Morphological patterns of wings and genitalia show similar geographical patterns as allozyme data. (c) 2005 The Linnean Society of London.

The genetic structure of hawthorn-infesting Rhagoletis pomonella populations in Mexico: implications for sympatric host race formation	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						Eje Volcanico Trans Mexicano; microsatellites; population structure; speciation mode plurality	APPLE MAGGOT FLY; MICROSATELLITE LOCI; SPECIATION; HYBRIDIZATION; TEPHRITIDAE; ADAPTATION; DIVERGENCE; ALLOZYMES; EXPANSION; DIPTERA	The genetic origins of species may not all trace to the same time and place as the proximate cause(s) for population divergence. Moreover, inherent gene-flow barriers separating populations may not all have evolved under the same geographical circumstances. These considerations have lead to a greater appreciation of the plurality of speciation: that one geographical mode for divergence may not always be sufficient to describe a speciation event. The apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella, a model system for sympatric speciation via host-plant shifting, has been a surprising contributor to the concept of speciation mode plurality. Previous studies have suggested that past introgression of inversion polymorphism from a hawthorn-fly population in the trans-Mexican volcanic belt (EVTM) introduced diapause life-history variation into a more northern fly population that subsequently contributed to sympatric host race formation and speciation in the United States (US). Here, we report results from a microsatellite survey implying (i) that volcanic activity in the eastern EVTM may have been responsible for the initial geographical isolation of the Mexican and northern hawthorn-fly populations c. 1.57 mya; and (ii) that flies in the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains (SMO) likely served as a conduit for past gene flow from the EVTM into the US. Indeed, the microsatellite data suggest that the current US population may represent a range expansion from the northern SMO. We discuss the implications of these findings for sympatric race formation in Rhagoletis and speciation theory.

Applying polymorphic allozyme loci, we analyse the late Wurm glacial and postglacial range dynamics of the temperate butterfly species Erebia medusa in eastern Central Europe near to its present northern distribution limit. We analysed the genetic structure of 36 E.medusa populations (n=1508) from the Northern Carpathians and Sudety Mountains and the surrounding areas in eastern Germany, southern Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and north-eastern Hungary. We used various descriptive statistics and explorative cluster analyses on an individual, population and group level. The genetic diversities of the populations mostly correspond with those known from samples in other parts of the species distribution range. The differentiations among population groups are in the order of magnitude of other butterfly species evolving genetic lineages over at least one glacial-interglacial cycle. From four different genetic lineages, three lineages supported the existence of extra-Mediterranean refugia postulated in previous studies. The fourth lineage indicated one exceptionally northern extra-Mediterranean refuge in southern Poland, strongly separated from the more southern centres by the Sudety Mountains and Northern Carpathians; however, its postglacial origin out of a Transylvanian refuge cannot be ruled out completely. The genetic substructure of the Polish populations mirrors their dynamics of expansion and retraction caused by climatic oscillation during the late Wurm ice age. This pattern was further supported by a within-lineage hybrid zone in south-central Poland established between two groups of populations on either side, most probably resulting from final postglacial range expansion.

Morph-ratio dines are described for four diallelic genes A, B, C and L, each of which influences the visual phenotype. Each of the four dines has a different orientation, consistent with an hypothesis thai the polymorphism originated from hybridization between a number of polytypic demes which have at Various times undergone range expansion. Allopatric subspeciation in isolated Pleistocene refugia is postulated. The phenotype of each geographical race is shared with one of the morphs within the hybrid zone; other sympatrically maintained polymorphic forms are normally confined to the hybrid zone. Wright's isolation-by-distance model best explains the present distribution of gene frequencies. Morph-ratios differ significantly between the sexes and are sometimes associated with heterozygote excess; gametic and genotypic disequilibria are general throughout the region and suggest the dines are maintained by strong natural selection. Seasonal cycling of phenotype frequency is believed to result from extensive migratory movements rather than natural selection. Female-biased sex-ratio, which is also seasonal, and Haldane rule effects, result from hybrid breakdown when genetically distinct demes meet and interbreed. Oscillating sex-ratios and frequency of colour genes are functionally linked by negative feedback. The polymorphism owes its origin to allopatric evolution but is now maintained sympatrically.

Evidence for suppression of immunity as a driver for genomic introgressions and host range expansion in races of Albugo candida, a generalist parasite	ELIFE			English	Article							ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; BRASSICA-NAPUS; MOSAIC STRUCTURE; SEQUENCE; RESISTANCE; EVOLUTION; PATHOGEN; FUNGAL; GENE; IDENTIFICATION	How generalist parasites with wide host ranges can evolve is a central question in parasite evolution. Albugo candida is an obligate biotrophic parasite that consists of many physiological races that each specialize on distinct Brassicaceae host species. By analyzing genome sequence assemblies of five isolates, we show they represent three races that are genetically diverged by similar to 1%. Despite this divergence, their genomes are mosaic-like, with similar to 25% being introgressed from other races. Sequential infection experiments show that infection by adapted races enables subsequent infection of hosts by normally non-infecting races. This facilitates introgression and the exchange of effector repertoires, and may enable the evolution of novel races that can undergo clonal population expansion on new hosts. We discuss recent studies on hybridization in other eukaryotes such as yeast, Heliconius butterflies, Darwin's finches, sunflowers and cichlid fishes, and the implications of introgression for pathogen evolution in an agro-ecological environment.

As these systems change, they pose significant ecological, social, and economic risk through, for example, the loss of valuable habitat, green space, and timber. Our understanding of such systems is often limited by the complexity of multiple interacting taxa. As a consequence, studies assessing the ecology, physiology, and genomics of each key organism in such systems are increasingly important for developing appropriate management strategies. Here we summarize the genetic and genomic contributions made by the TRIA project-a long-term study of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) system encompassing beetle, fungi, and pine. Contributions include genetic and genomic resources for species identification, sex determination, detection of selection, functional genetic analysis, mating system confirmation, hybrid stability tests, and integrated genetic studies of multiple taxa. These resources and subsequent findings have accelerated our understanding of the mountain pine beetle system, facilitating improved management strategies (e.g., enhancements to stand susceptibility indices and predictive models) and highlighting mechanisms for promoting resilient forests. Further, work from the TRIA project serves as a model for the increasing number and severity of invasive and native forest insect outbreaks globally (e.g., Dutch elm disease and thousand cankers disease).

Host and geography together drive early adaptive radiation of Hawaiian planthoppers	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						exon capture; island biogeography; Nesosydne; planthopper; population genomics	SPECIES-DIVERSITY; GENERATION; MITOCHONDRIAL; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; PLANTS; DIVERSIFICATION; SPECIALIZATION; INTROGRESSION; DISCORDANCE	The interactions between insects and their plant host have been implicated in driving diversification of both players. Early arguments highlighted the role of ecological opportunity, with the idea that insects "escape and radiate" on new hosts, with subsequent hypotheses focusing on the interplay between host shifting and host tracking, coupled with isolation and fusion, in generating diversity. Because it is rarely possible to capture the initial stages of diversification, it is particularly difficult to ascertain the relative roles of geographic isolation versus host shifts in initiating the process. The current study examines genetic diversity between populations and hosts within a single species of endemic Hawaiian planthopper, Nesosydne umbratica (Hemiptera, Delphacidae). Given that the species was known as a host generalist occupying unrelated hosts, Clermontia (Campanulaceae) and Pipturus (Urticaceae), we set out to determine the relative importance of geography and host in structuring populations in the early stages of differentiation on the youngest islands of the Hawaiian chain. Results from extensive exon capture data showed that N. umbratica is highly structured, both by geography, with discrete populations on each volcano, and by host plant, with parallel radiations on Clermontia and Pipturus leading to extensive co-occurrence. The marked genetic structure suggests that populations can readily become established on novel hosts provided opportunity; subsequent adaptation allows monopolization of the new host. The results support the role of geographic isolation in structuring populations and with host shifts occurring as discrete events that facilitate subsequent parallel geographic range expansion.

Tree defense response was initiated by inoculation of trees with the MPB associated fungus Grosmannia clavigera and measured through monoterpene emission from tree boles and concentration of defensive compounds in phloem, needles, and necrotic lesion tissues. Lodgepole pine generally emitted higher amounts of monoterpenes than jack pine; particularly from fungal-inoculated trees. Compared to non inoculated trees, fungal inoculation increased monoterpene emission in both species, whereas water treatment had no effect on monoterpene emission. The phloem of both pine species contains (-)-alpha-pinene, the precursor of the beetle's aggregation pheromone, however lodgepole pine contains two times as much as jack pine. The concentration of defensive compounds was 70-fold greater in the lesion tissue in jack pine, but only 10-fold in lodgepole pine compared to healthy phloem tissue in each species, respectively. Water-deficit treatment inhibited an increase of L-limonene as response to fungal inoculation in lodgepole pine phloem. The amount of myrcene in jack pine phloem was higher in water-deficit trees compared to ambient trees. Beetles reared in jack pine were not affected by either water or biological treatment, whereas beetles reared in lodgepole pine benefited from fungal inoculation by producing heavier female offspring. Female beetles that emerged from jack pine bolts contained more fat than those that emerged from lodgepole pine, even though lodgepole pine phloem had a higher nitrogen content than jack pine phloem. These results suggest that jack pine chemistry is suitable for MPB pheromone production and aggregation on the host tree.

Today, S. richteri occupies higher latitudes and colder areas, while S. invicta occupies lower latitudes. Between the distributions of the two species, there is a large area of viable hybrid (S. richteri x S. invicta) populations. This study aimed to characterize the forces driving this distribution pattern and the underlying mechanisms. Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of freshly killed workers of S. invicta, hybrids, and S. richteri were removed using hexane. Both intact and CHCs-extracted workers were subjected to a constant rate of increasing temperature from 10 to 60 degrees C to obtain relative water loss and the water loss transition temperature (Tc-ant). Mass loss and Tc-ant were both significantly increased with CHCs removal. We then examined the CHC composition of three species. CHC profiles of S. richteri are characterized by significant amounts of short-chain (C-23-C-27) saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. In contrast, profiles of S. invicta consist primarily of long chain (C-27-C-29) saturated hydrocarbons; unsaturated alkenes are completely lacking. Hybrid fire ants show intermediate profiles of the two parent species. We measured the melting point (T-m) and water-loss transition temperature of CHC blends (Tc-CHC) of different ant species colonies using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and an artificial membrane system, respectively. There were 3-5 T(m)s of each CHCs sample of different ant colonies due to their complex chemistry. The highest T(m)s (T(m-max)s) of CHCs samples from S. invicta and the hybrid were significantly higher than that from S. richteri. The correlation between Tc-CHC and Tm-max obtained from the same CHCs sample was highly significant. These results reveal that species having higher T-c and Tm-max retain more water under relatively higher temperature, and consequently are able to occupy warmer environments. We conclude that CHC chemistry plays a role in shaping current distribution patterns of S. richteri, S. invicta and their hybrid in the United States.

During Ice Ages, populations isolated in allopatric glacial refugia can experience differentiation in reproductive traits through divergence in selection regimes. This phenomenon may lead to reproductive isolation and dramatically accentuates the consequences of the climatic oscillations on species. Alternatively, when reproductive isolation is incomplete and populations are expanding again, further mating between the formerly isolated populations can result in the formation of a hybrid zone, genetic introgression or reinforcement speciation through reproductive trait displacements. Therefore changes in reproductive traits driven by population movements during climatic oscillations can act as an important force in promoting pre-zygotic isolation. Notwithstanding, divergence of reproductive traits has not been approached in the context of climatic oscillations. Here we investigate the impact of population movements driven by climatic oscillations on a reproductive trait of a bumblebee species (Bombus lapidarius). We characterise the pattern of variation and differentiation across the species distribution (i) with five genes (nuclear and mitochondrial), and (ii) in the chemical composition of male marking secretions (MMS), a key trait for mate attraction in bumblebees. Results: Our results provide evidence that populations have experienced a genetic allopatric differentiation, in at least three main refugia (the Balkans, Centre-Eastern Europe, and Southern Italy) during Quaternary glaciations. The comparative chemical analyses show that populations from the Southern Italian refugium have experienced MMS differentiation and an incipient speciation process from another refugium. The meeting of Southern Italian populations with other populations as a result of range expansion at a secondary contact zone seems to have led to a reinforcement process on local MMS patterns. Conclusions: This study suggests that population movement during Quaternary climatic oscillations can lead to divergence in reproductive traits by allopatric differentiation during Ice Ages and by reinforcement during post-glacial recolonization.

Tracking invasions of a destructive defoliator, the gypsy moth (Erebidae: Lymantria dispar): Population structure, origin of intercepted specimens, and Asian introgression into North America	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						admixture zone; amplicon sequencing; Asian gypsy moths; assignment test; Invasive species; natural hybrids	GENETIC-VARIATION; FEMALE FLIGHT; DNA VARIATION; LEPIDOPTERA; HYBRIDIZATION; SOFTWARE; PATTERNS; PROGRAM; EVENTS	Genetic data can help elucidate the dynamics of biological invasions, which are fueled by the constant expansion of international trade. The introduction of European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar) into North America is a classic example of human-aided invasion that has caused tremendous damage to North American temperate forests. Recently, the even more destructive Asian gypsy moth (mainly L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica) has been intercepted in North America, mostly transported by cargo ships. To track invasion pathways, we developed a diagnostic panel of 60 DNA loci (55 nuclear and 5 mitochondrial) to characterize worldwide genetic differentiation within L. dispar and its sister species L. umbrosa. Hierarchical analyses supported strong differentiation and recovered five geographic groups that correspond to (1) North America, (2) Europe plus North Africa and Middle East, (3) the Urals, Central Asia, and Russian Siberia, (4) continental East Asia, and (5) the Japanese islands. Interestingly, L. umbrosa was grouped with L. d. japonica, and the introduced North American population exhibits remarkable distinctiveness from contemporary European counterparts. Each geographic group, except for North America, shows additional lower-level structures when analyzed individually, which provided the basis for inference of the origin of invasive specimens. Two assignment approaches consistently identified a coastal area of continental East Asia as the major source for Asian invasion during 2014-2015, with Japan being another source. By analyzing simulation and laboratory crosses, we further provided evidence for the occurrence of natural Asian-North American hybrids in the Pacific Northwest, raising concerns for introgression of Asian alleles that may accelerate range expansion of gypsy moth in North America. Our study demonstrates how genetic data contribute to bio-surveillance of invasive species with results that can inform regulatory management and reduce the frequency of trade-associated invasions.

We sought to refine the genetic and geographic distribution of this hybrid zone in western North America to provide information important in predicting future risk of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreaks. Weused 29 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to discriminate lodgepole pine, jack pine, and their hybrids. We compared and contrasted spatial patterns of hybridization in northern and southern forest zones based on the colonization history of the two species. We found that patterns of introgression were more similar between the zones than expected by chance, but there were significant differences between these regions at specific loci. Using logistic regression, we created a robust predictive model to distinguish among lodgepole pine, jack pine, and their hybrids using a combination of geographic and environmental predictors. Using model selection based on Akaike information criterion, we found that location, elevation, and moisture are important predictors for species class. Quantification of the genetic differences between these two regions, combined with an accurate model for predicting the spatial distribution of lodgepole pine, jack pine, and their hybrids, provides essential information for continued effective management of forest resources.

The milfoil weevil's preference for the nonindigenous plant can be induced during juvenile development or through exposure to Eurasian watermilfoil as an adult. We evaluated how the fecundity of the milfoil weevil was affected over time by juvenile and adult exposure to the native, invasive and invasive x native hybrid milfoils and whether fecundity was correlated with host plant quality. Weevils reared on Eurasian watermilfoil laid more eggs than those reared on northern or hybrid watermilfoils. When weevils were collected from and exposed to milfoils collected directly from a lake, Eurasian-reared weevils had higher fecundity and greater preference for Eurasian over northern watermilfoil. When weevils were reared on and allowed to oviposit on milfoils grown in a common environment, the differences in fecundity and preference for Eurasian over northern or hybrid watermilfoils diminished. In Eurasian-northern experiments, milfoil weevils laid more than 80% of their eggs on Eurasian watermilfoil, but that value decreased when plants from common environments were used. Despite this preference, most weevils continued to use both hosts indicating that a complete host switch is unlikely. Weevils showed no oviposition preference between Eurasian and hybrid milfoils. The milfoil weevil had higher fecundity on Eurasian watermilfoil, which had a higher concentration of carbon, polyphenols and lignin than did northern watermilfoil, which had a higher concentration of ash. The milfoil weevil's preference for Eurasian watermilfoil was affected by changes in plant chemistry, and ash appeared to act as a deterrent to oviposition on northern watermilfoil. The milfoil weevil can modify its response based on host-plant chemistry.

J	Krehenwinkel, H; Tautz, D				Krehenwinkel, Henrik; Tautz, Diethard			Northern range expansion of European populations of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi is associated with global warmingcorrelated genetic admixture and population-specific temperature adaptations	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						adaptation; climate change; genetic admixture; historical DNA; range expansion	CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOLOGICAL INVASION; RAPID EVOLUTION; HYBRIDIZATION; RESPONSES; ARANEAE; INTROGRESSION; INCREASES; NICHE; SIZE	Poleward range expansions are observed for an increasing number of species, which may be an effect of global warming during the past decades. However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions reflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether new genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the expansion of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe during the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary populations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography and genetic changes associated with the range shift. Based on the analysis of mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP markers, we observe a higher level of genetic diversity in the expanding populations, apparently due to admixture of formerly isolated lineages. Using reciprocal transplant experiments for testing overwintering tolerance, as well as temperature preference and tolerance tests in the laboratory, we find that the invading spiders have possibly shifted their temperature niche. This may be a key adaptation for survival in Northern latitudes. The museum samples allow a reconstruction of the invasion's genetic history. A first, small-scale range shift started around 1930, in parallel with the onset of global warming. A more massive invasion of Northern Europe associated with genetic admixture and morphological changes occurred in later decades. We suggest that the latter range expansion into far Northern latitudes may be a consequence of the admixture that provided the genetic material for adaptations to new environmental regimes. Hence, global warming could have facilitated the initial admixture of populations and this resulted in genetic lineages with new habitat preferences.

Potential Geographic Distributions and Successful Invasions of Parthenogenetic Broad-Nosed Weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) Native to South America	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						parthenogenesis; invasive species; South American weevils; niche modeling; agricultural pests	TRIBE NAUPACTINI COLEOPTERA; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; SAMPLE-SIZE; BOLL-WEEVIL; 1ST RECORDS; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; INFECTION; RANGE	Ten species of parthenogenetic broad-nosed weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae) native to Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay were selected for niche modeling analysis based on climatic data and altitude, to evaluate their potential range expansion inside and outside South America. The selected species belong to five genera of the tribe Naupactini affecting economically important crops. Until present, five of the 10 species analyzed here have invaded prairies and steppes of countries outside South America (Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, United States, and South Africa): Aramigus tessellatus (Say), Atrichonotus sordidus (Hustache), Atrichonotus taeniatulus (Berg), Naupactus leucoloma Boheman, and Naupactus peregrinus (Buchanan). Our niche modeling analyses performed with MAXENT demonstrated that these areas would be also suitable for Aramigus conirostris (Hustache), Eurymetopus fallax (Boheman), Pantomorus auripes Hustache, Pantomorus ruizi (Brethes), and Pantomorus viridisquamosus (Boheman), consequently, they also have the potential to invade areas outside their native ranges, mainly in southeastern United States, some European countries (e.g., Portugal, France, and southern England), South Africa, New Zealand, and southeastern Australia. All the studied species share similar environmental requirements, the most important variables being the Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter, the Annual Mean Temperature and Isothermality. Long distance dispersal through commercial trade, and parthenogenetic reproduction would increase the threat of these weevils to crop production worldwide.	[Lanteri, A. A.; Del Rio, M.

Introduced insects often incorporate native plants into their diets and might be expected to show a predilection for novel hosts that are phylogenetically related to their normal hosts. The lily leaf beetle, Lilioceris lilii (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an introduced pest of cultivated lilies. Oviposition behaviour, larval behaviour, and development of L. lilii was examined on a range of potential host plants, as well as on the normal host, Asiatic hybrid lilies Lilium sp. 2. Neonate larval feeding behaviour was quantified on 15 food plant species: 10 from the Liliales, three from the Asparagales and two eudicots. Larvae fed plants closely related to the genus Lilium were more likely to initiate feeding, less likely to abandon their food leaf, and consumed more leaf area. 3. In no-choice tests, females oviposited on the novel hosts Lilium philadelphicum, Medeola virginiana, Clintonia borealis, Streptopus amplexifolius, and Polygonatum biflorum; however, all but L. philadelphicum received very few eggs. Non-Lilium novel hosts were not used for oviposition when presented along with Asiatic lilies in choice tests. 4. A single individual was reared to the adult stage on the novel host S. amplexifolius. Several larvae survived to the pupal stage on M. virginiana, although no adults emerged from those pupae. Larvae reared on the native wood lily L. philadelphicum performed equally well or better than on the Asiatic cultivar. 5. Our results indicate that the lily leaf beetle poses a threat to native Liliaceae. Several native Lilium species, including L. philadelphicum, are threatened or endangered in certain jurisdictions throughout their range; these species should be monitored closely for colonisation by the beetle.

Hybridization and range expansion in tamarisk beetles (Diorhabda spp.) introduced to North America for classical biological control	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS			English	Article						biological control; de novo genome assembly; hybridization; invasion genomics; RADseq; range expansion	ELONGATA-DESERTICOLA COLEOPTERA; CONTROL AGENT; LEAF BEETLE; GENETIC-VARIATION; HOST-SPECIFICITY; READ ALIGNMENT; DAY LENGTH; CHRYSOMELIDAE; ESTABLISHMENT; EVOLUTION	With the global rise of human-mediated translocations and invasions, it is critical to understand the genomic consequences of hybridization and mechanisms of range expansion. Conventional wisdom is that high genetic drift and loss of genetic diversity due to repeated founder effects will constrain introduced species. However, reduced genetic variation can be countered by behavioral aspects and admixture with other distinct populations. As planned invasions, classical biological control (biocontrol) agents present important opportunities to understand the mechanisms of establishment and spread in a novel environment. The ability of biocontrol agents to spread and adapt, and their effects on local ecosystems, depends on genomic variation and the consequences of admixture in novel environments. Here, we use a biocontrol system to examine the genome-wide outcomes of introduction, spread, and hybridization in four cryptic species of a biocontrol agent, the tamarisk beetle (Diorhabda carinata, D. carinulata, D. elongata, and D. sublineata), introduced from six localities across Eurasia to control the invasive shrub tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) in western North America. We assembled a de novo draft reference genome and applied RADseq to over 500 individuals across laboratory cultures, the native ranges, and the introduced range. Despite evidence of a substantial genetic bottleneck among D. carinulata in N. America, populations continue to establish and spread, possibly due to aggregation behavior. We found that D. carinata, D. elongata, and D. sublineata hybridize in the field to varying extents, with D. carinata x D. sublineata hybrids being the most abundant. Genetic diversity was greater at sites with hybrids, highlighting potential for increased ability to adapt and expand. Our results demonstrate the complex patterns of genomic variation that can result from introduction of multiple ecotypes or species for biocontrol, and the importance of understanding them to predict and manage the effects of biocontrol agents in novel ecosystems.

Population genetic analyses of complex global insect invasions in managed landscapes: a Leptocybe invasa (Hymenoptera) case study	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Invasive insect pest; Gall wasp; Forest entomology; Complex invasion pathways	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DNA-SEQUENCE; PARTHENOGENESIS; SOFTWARE; HISTORY; SUSCEPTIBILITY; IDENTIFICATION; MITOCHONDRIAL; POLYMORPHISM; EULOPHIDAE	Increased rates of movement and the accumulation of insects establishing outside their native range is leading to the 'global homogenization' of agricultural and forestry pests. We use an invasive wasp, Leptocybe invasa (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), as a case study to highlight the rapid and complex nature of these global invasions and how they can complicate management options. To trace the invasion history of L. invasa globally, we characterised the genetic diversity within and between populations from its origin and invaded regions using mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Three mitochondrial Haplogroups were identified, of which two are likely different species that appear to have been independently introduced into different parts of the world. One type (Mitochondrial Haplogroup 1) occurs globally, and is the exclusive type found in Europe, the Middle East, South America and most of Africa. The second type (Mitochondrial Haplogroup 2) co-occurs with the first-type in Laos, South Africa, Thailand and Vietnam, while a third type (Mitochondrial Haplogroup 3) occurs exclusively in Australia, its native range. The distinction of the two invasive Haplogroups was supported by analysis of newly developed simple sequence repeat (microsatellite) markers in populations from 13 countries. Further analyses using clustering methods and approximate Bayesian computation suggested the occurrence of hybridisation in the Laos population and revealed that an unsampled population was the origin of Mitochondrial Haplogroup 1. The analyses also showed little genetic differentiation within the invasive populations, suggesting a limited original introduction from a very small population followed by rapid, global range expansion in a stepwise fashion. Results of this study should provide some guidelines for characterizing invasion pathways of new invasive insect pests.	[Dittrich-Schroder, G.; Hurley, B. P.; Wingfield, M.

Throughout Asia and in much of Africa the species is in fact monomorphic and polytypic, as expected. It is, however, polymorphic for 3-4 colour genes over a large area of central and eastern Africa, where deviant sex ratios and non-Mendelian segregations also occur. All-female broods are widespread and frequent, often outnumbering bisexual progenies and giving rise to heavily female-biased populations. Full and partial sex linkage, which is not controlled from the X or Y chromosomes, and male-biased broods also occur. Genetical analysis for the BC-autosome carrying colour genes suggests there are two: probably mitochondrial, cytotypes (microbe-induced early male death syndrome is considered unlikely) and an autosomal, incompatibility (I) gene, two alleles of which are male-specific killers. F2 and backcross matings by females heterozygous at the I-locus give progenies which are either thelygenic, all males dying at or soon after hatching, or bisexual but showing full or partial sex linkage. Male death is attributed to nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility (NCI). Females achieve reversion from a thelygenic to a bisexual line by mating with males of compatible (maternal) cytotype. A second NCI system causes meiotic drive in female oogenesis for a cytoplasmically compatible A-autosome, with no effect on SR. The array or, non-Mendelian segregations for ses and two autosomes, with switching between bisexual and unisexual lineages, indicates autosomal intragenomic conflict with the outcome that one autosome is preserved from elimination in females,and the other condemned in dead males. The geographical distribution of the colour marker genes suggests, that the polymorphisms hale a hybrid origin involving several once allopatric subspecies: some of which hale divergent cytotypes. Secondary contact probably followed range expansion induced by thr periodic spread of savanna during the Pleistocene and massive deforestation by man in recent times. The unusual extent of, the hybrid zone is attributed to the large number of subspecies involved in its origin, and to introgression promoted hy the butterfly's extensive migratory activity.

In order to clarify the phylogeo-graphic history of the species, we used sequences of three mitochondrial (COI, Cyt b and ND5) and two nuclear (Rp15 and Ldh) genes of 207 individuals collected from 55 sites throughout Japan and five sites on the Asian continent. Phylogenetic trees and the median-joining network revealed six evolutionary mitochondrial haplotype clades, which corresponded to the geographic distribution of the species. Common ancestors of Japanese T. fischeri might have come to Japan during the mid-Pleistocene by multiple dispersals of continental populations, probably via a land bridge or narrow channel between western Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The geographical patterns of variation of mitochondrial and nuclear markers are discordant in northeastern Kyushu, possibly as a result of introgressive hybridization during the ancient contact between the Kyushu and Shikoku populations in the last glacial maximum. The phylogeographic pattern of T. fischeri in Japan are probably related to the geological history, Pleistocene climatic oscillations and distribution of the host plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Investigation of the spatial distribution of 71 Cpnl-1 haplotypes and estimation of levels of genetic differentiation (K-ST values) between populations and geographic regions provided evidence for subdivision of C. parallelus into at least five major geographic regions and indicated that the French form of C. parallelus originated after range expansion from a Balkan refugium. Further evidence for subdivision of C. parallelus between Italy and northern Europe suggests that the Alps may have formed a significant barrier to gene flow in this grasshopper.

The influence of variation in host tree monoterpene composition on secondary attraction by an invasive bark beetle: Implications for range expansion and potential host shift by the mountain pine beetle	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dendroctonus; Climate change; Range expansion; alpha-Pinene; Pheromone production	DENDROCTONUS-PONDEROSAE HOPKINS; LODGEPOLE PINE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHEROMONE PRODUCTION; BRITISH-COLUMBIA; COLEOPTERA; FOREST; RESPONSES; DEFENSE; PLANTS	The range of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) has expanded in recent years to include many evolutionarily naive forests in western Canada. These forests include novel populations of the principal host species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the novel species jack pine (Pinus banksiana), and their hybrids (P. contorta x P. banksiana). These novel forests are chemically and physically different than native forests, and recent studies have shown beetle reproductive performance is enhanced in these novel habitats. We conducted a field experiment to determine the effect of differing host chemistry, specifically alpha-pinene content, on secondary attraction by foraging mountain pine beetles. Alpha-pinene is the precursor molecule for the production of trans-verbenol, the main aggregation pheromone for this beetle species. We found that elevated relative concentrations of a-pinene in bolts significantly increased their attractiveness to in situ mountain pine beetles. Seventy-five percent of attacks were found on infested bolts with the most a-pinene relative to other monoterpenes. Other measures of terpene chemistry between bolt types could not explain the pattern of attacks. This result suggests that elevated concentrations of a-pinene could increase the rate of aggregation and attack success by the mountain pine beetle in novel pine forests. Newly invaded hybrid and jack pine in the western boreal forest are reported to contain 3-4 times the relative concentration of a-pinene than lodgepole pines in forests in which the beetle has coevolved. These elevated concentrations may help the mountain pine beetle overcome some of the potential restraints for establishment and spread in the boreal forest, such as low pine volume and connectivity, and continue expanding its range.

Mountain Pine Beetles Colonizing Historical and Naive Host Trees Are Associated with a Bacterial Community Highly Enriched in Genes Contributing to Terpene Metabolism	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; RANGE EXPANSION; GENOME ANNOTATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BARK BEETLES; IPS-PINI; BIODEGRADATION; SYSTEM; REPRODUCTION; DEGRADATION	The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, is a subcortical herbivore native to western North America that can kill healthy conifers by overcoming host tree defenses, which consist largely of high terpene concentrations. The mechanisms by which these beetles contend with toxic compounds are not well understood. Here, we explore a component of the hypothesis that beetle-associated bacterial symbionts contribute to the ability of D. ponderosae to overcome tree defenses by assisting with terpene detoxification. Such symbionts may facilitate host tree transitions during range expansions currently being driven by climate change. For example, this insect has recently breached the historical geophysical barrier of the Canadian Rocky Mountains, providing access to naive tree hosts and unprecedented connectivity to eastern forests. We use culture-independent techniques to describe the bacterial community associated with D. ponderosae beetles and their galleries from their historical host, Pinus contorta, and their more recent host, hybrid P. contorta-Pinus banksiana. We show that these communities are enriched with genes involved in terpene degradation compared with other plant biomass-processing microbial communities. These pine beetle microbial communities are dominated by members of the genera Pseudomonas, Rahnella, Serratia, and Burkholderia, and the majority of genes involved in terpene degradation belong to these genera. Our work provides the first metagenome of bacterial communities associated with a bark beetle and is consistent with a potential microbial contribution to detoxification of tree defenses needed to survive the subcortical environment.

A powerful approach is to compare patterns of trait differences between populations differing in their evolutionary histories. A recent study of genetic divergence between populations of the meadow grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus, from different locations around Europe has allowed us to use this species to investigate which aspects of evolutionary history are associated with divergence in morphology and mating signals. During the last glaciation C. parallelus was confined to a number of refugia in southern Europe and has subsequently recolonized the northern part of the continent. This process of isolation followed by range expansion has created populations differing markedly in their evolutionary pasts-some have been isolated from one another for thousands of years, others have undergone repeated founder events, and others now live in sympatry with a closely related species. Using laboratory-reared grasshoppers from 12 different populations with a range of evolutionary histories, we quantify differences in morphology, chemical signals, and male calling-song. The observed pattern of divergence between these populations is then compared with the pattern predicted by hypotheses about what drives divergence. This comparison reveals that long periods in allopatry and processes associated with repeated founder events are both strongly associated with divergence.

A well-documented example of a range expansion during the past decades is provided by the European wasp spider Argiope bruennichi. Using ecological niche modeling, thermal tolerance experiments and a genome-wide analysis of gene expression divergence, we show that invasive populations have adapted to novel climatic conditions in the course of their expansion. Their climatic niche shift is mirrored in an increased cold tolerance and a population-specific and functionally differentiated gene expression response. We generated an Argiope reference genome sequence and used population genome resequencing to assess genomic changes associated with the new climatic adaptations. We find clear genetic differentiation and a significant admixture with alleles from East Asian populations in the invasive Northern European populations. Population genetic modeling suggests that at least some of these introgressing alleles have contributed to the new adaptations during the expansion. Our results thus confirm the notion that range expansions are not a simple consequence of climate change, but are accompanied by fast genetic changes and adaptations that may be fuelled through admixture between long separated lineages.

Ten haplotypes were identified in 21 populations, representing six species. Haplotype diversity was as great within species, and in same case within populations, as it was among species and no clear geographical patterns of haplotype distribution were revealed. In the light of grasshopper range changes since the last glaciation it is unlikely that these data can be explained entirely by the retention of ancestral polymorphism. This suggests that hybridization has occurred during periods of grasshopper range expansion since the last glacial maximum, allowing mtDNA transfer between populations that have previously diverged in allopatry.

The three species proved reproductively isolated in the field, with no gene exchange. Their speciation seem to have occurred long before the agricultural revolution, crop colonization representing a host range expansion rather than a host shift, as in sympatric speciation.

Origin of Pest Lineages of the Colorado Potato Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						invasion biology; phylogeography; population genetics	LEPTINOTARSA-DECEMLINEATA COLEOPTERA; GEOGRAPHIC POPULATIONS; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SOFTWARE; INSECT; MARKERS; RESISTANCE; RESPONSES; SURVIVAL; VOYAGE	Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say [Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae]) is a pest of potato throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but little is known about the beetle's origins as a pest. We sampled the beetle from uncultivated Solanum host plants in Mexico, and from pest and non-pest populations in the United States and used mitochondrial DNA and nuclear loci to examine three hypotheses on the origin of the pest lineages: 1) the pest beetles originated from Mexican populations, 2) they descended from hybridization between previously divergent populations, or 3) they descended from populations that are native to the Plains states in the United States. Mitochondrial haplotypes of non-pest populations from Mexico and Arizona differed substantially from beetles collected from the southern plains and potato fields in the United States, indicating that beetles from Mexico and Arizona did not contribute to founding the pest lineages. Similar results were observed for AFLP and microsatellite data. In contrast, non-pest populations from the states of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas were genetically similar to U.S. pest populations, indicating that they contributed to the founding of the pest lineages. Most of the pest populations do not show a significant reduction in genetic diversity compared to the plains populations in the United States. We conclude that genetically heterogeneous beetle populations expanded onto potato from native Solanum hosts. This mode of host range expansion may have contributed to the abundant genetic diversity of contemporary populations, perhaps contributing to the rapid evolution of climate tolerance, host range, and insecticide resistance.

We used two different molecular markers to elucidate the effects of these reproductive modes on the colonization ability and genetic variability of both species. First, we investigated the occurrence of clonal reproduction in the putative parthenogenetic species (i.e. significant bias in sex ratio) and second, whether parthenogenesis was associated with higher colonization ability and low levels of genetic variability in marginal environments compared with those of the bisexual species. We assessed the central and marginal areas of distribution of these species with ecological niche modeling that includes environmental variables and with landscape interpolation of molecular variability. Our results support the idea that parthenogenetic species are more successful than bisexual ones in colonizing new environments. N. leucoloma is most probably apomictic, and would have recently experienced significant population growth concomitant with an important geographic range expansion to distant areas with moderately suitable environmental conditions. On the other hand, the populations of the bisexual species, N. xanthographus, seem to have maintained fairly constant sizes, expanding its geographic distribution to locations close to the proposed ancestral area.

Genetic structure, admixture and invasion success in a Holarctic defoliator, the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar, Lepidoptera: Erebidae)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						global phylogeography; hybridization; invasion success; microsatellite; mitochondrial DNA; Pleistocene glaciation	RANGE EXPANSION; DNA VARIATION; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; DIVERSITY; PROGRAM; POPULATIONS; SPECIATION; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS	Characterizing the current population structure of potentially invasive species provides a critical context for identifying source populations and for understanding why invasions are successful. Non-native populations inevitably lose genetic diversity during initial colonization events, but subsequent admixture among independently introduced lineages may increase both genetic variation and adaptive potential. Here we characterize the population structure of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar Linnaeus), one of the world's most destructive forest pests. Native to Eurasia and recently introduced to North America, the current distribution of gypsy moth includes forests throughout the temperate region of the northern hemisphere. Analyses of microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA sequences for 1738 individuals identified four genetic clusters within L.dispar. Three of these clusters correspond to the three named subspecies; North American populations represent a distinct fourth cluster, presumably a consequence of the population bottleneck and allele frequency change that accompanied introduction. We find no evidence that admixture has been an important catalyst of the successful invasion and range expansion in North America. However, we do find evidence of ongoing hybridization between subspecies and increased genetic variation in gypsy moth populations from Eastern Asia, populations that now pose a threat of further human-mediated introductions. Finally, we show that current patterns of variation can be explained in terms of climate and habitat changes during the Pleistocene, a time when temperate forests expanded and contracted. Deeply diverged matrilines in Europe imply that gypsy moths have been there for a long time and are not recent arrivals from Asia.

Ecological studies have demonstrated that stressed trees are more susceptible to attack by mountain pine beetle than their healthy counterparts. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that water deficit affects constitutive and induced responses of mature lodgepole pine x jack pine hybrids (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Wats. x Pinus banksiana Lamb.) to inoculation with the mountain pine beetle fungal associate Grosmannia clavigera (Robinson-Jeffrey and Davidson) Zipfel, de Beer and Wingfield. The degree of stress induced by the imposed water-deficit treatment was sufficient to reduce photosynthesis. Grosmannia clavigera-induced lesions exhibited significantly reduced dimensions in water-deficit trees relative to well-watered trees at 5 weeks after inoculation. Treatment-associated cellular-level changes in secondary phloem were also observed. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze transcript abundance profiles of 18 genes belonging to four families classically associated with biotic and abiotic stress responses: aquaporins (AQPs), dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB), terpene synthases (TPSs) and chitinases (CHIs). Transcript abundance profiles of a TIP2 AQP and a TINY-like DREB decreased significantly in fungus-inoculated trees, but not in response to water deficit. One TPS, Pcb(+)-3-carene synthase, and the Class II CHIs PcbCHI2.1 and PcbCHI2.2 showed increased expression under water-deficit conditions in the absence of fungal inoculation, while another TPS, Pcb(E)-beta-farnesene synthase-like, and two CHIs, PcbCHI1.1 and PcbCHI4.1, showed attenuated expression under water-deficit conditions in the presence of fungal inoculation. The effects were observed both locally and systemically. These results demonstrate that both constitutive and induced carbon-and nitrogen-based defenses are affected by water deficit, suggesting potential consequences for mountain pine beetle dynamics, particularly in novel environments.

Here, we explore speciation rates and historical biogeography of the ground beetles of the subgenus Ohomopterus ( genus Carabus) based on nuclear and mitochondrial gene sequences. Ohomopterus diverged into 15 species during the Pleistocene. The speciation rate was 1.92 Ma(-1) and was particularly fast ( 2.37 Ma(-1)) in a group with highly divergent genitalia. Speciation occurred almost solely within Honshu, the largest island with complex geography. Species diversity is highest in central Honshu, where closely related species occur parapatrically and different-sized species co-occur. Range expansion of some species in the past has resulted in such species assemblages. Introgressive hybridization, at least for mitochondrial DNA, has occurred repeatedly between species in contact, but has not greatly disturbed species distinctness. Small-island populations of some species were separated from main-island populations only after the last glacial ( or the last interglacial) period, indicating that island isolation had little role in speciation. Thus, the speciation and formation of the Ohomopterus assemblage occurred despite frequent opportunities for secondary contact and hybridization and the lack of persistent isolation. This radiation was achieved without substantial ecological differentiation, but with marked differentiation in mechanical agents of reproductive isolation ( body size and genital morphology).

This endeavour has the potential to benefit substantially from high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies through a rapid increase in the amount of data available and a corresponding increase in the precision of parameter estimation. Here we report the results of a phylogeographic study of the North American butterfly genus Lycaeides using 454 sequence data. This study serves the dual purpose of demonstrating novel molecular and analytical methods for population genetic analyses with 454 sequence data and expanding our knowledge of the phylogeographic history of Lycaeides. We obtained 341 045 sequence reads from 12 populations that we were able to assemble into 15 262 contigs (most of which were variable), representing one of the largest population genetic data sets for a non-model organism to date. We examined patterns of genetic variation using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of molecular variance model, which provides precise estimates of genome-level phi(ST) while appropriately modelling uncertainty in locus-specific phi(ST). We found that approximately 36% of sequence variation was partitioned among populations, suggesting historical or current isolation among the sampled populations. Estimates of pairwise genome-level phi(ST) were largely consistent with a previous phylogeographic model for Lycaeides, suggesting fragmentation into two to three refugia during Pleistocene glacial cycles followed by post-Pleistocene range expansion and secondary contact leading to introgressive hybridization. This study demonstrates the potential of using genome-level data to better understand the phylogeographic history of populations.	[Gompert, Zachariah; Buerkle, C.

The role of gene flow asymmetry along an environmental gradient in constraining local adaptation and range expansion	JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY			English	Article						diapause; gene flow asymmetry; maladaptive; range limits	ALLONEMOBIUS-FASCIATUS; SPECIES BORDERS; DENSITY REGULATION; BODY-SIZE; EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY; CRICKET; PATTERNS; HYBRIDIZATION; DROSOPHILA	Theoretically, asymmetric gene flow along an environmental gradient can limit species range expansion by keeping peripheral populations from locally adapting. However, few empirical studies have examined this potentially fundamental evolutionary mechanism. We address this possibility in the cricket Allonemobius socius, which exist along a season-length gradient where the probability of producing a single generation per year (univoltinism) increases with latitude. As the probability of univoltinism increases northwards, populations are expected to hedge their bets by producing a greater proportion of diapause eggs when exposed to a mild diapause cue. However, gene flow from southern populations may disrupt local adaptation in the north by reducing the proportion of diapause eggs (expected to be 100% in pure univoltine environments). This may limit range expansion along the northern periphery where A.socius compete with A.fasciatus, a sister species that exhibits an invariant diapause-only egg-laying strategy. To assess the potential for range limitation, we examined diapause incidence (the proportion of diapause eggs produced under diapause conditions), gene flow symmetry and population structure across nine A.socius populations. We found that gene flow was asymmetric and biased northwards towards the periphery. Furthermore, peripheral populations that inhabited pure univoltine environments produced numerous nondiapause eggs (a southern, bivoltine diapause phenotype), which we assume to be a suboptimal phenotype. These patterns suggest that asymmetric gene flow along the gradient constrains adaptation in peripheral populations, potentially constraining species range expansion.	[Fedorka, K.

Radiation with reticulation marks the origin of a major malaria vector	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						adaptive radiation; Anopheles funestus; anopheline mosquito species complex; introgression; reticulate evolution	ANOPHELES-FUNESTUS GILES; POLYTENE CHROMOSOMES; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; INTROGRESSION; DROSOPHILA; GAMBIAE; MITOCHONDRIAL; HYBRIDIZATION; EVOLUTION; MEGADROUGHTS	Advances in genomics have led to an appreciation that introgression is common, but its evolutionary consequences are poorly understood. In recent species radiations the sharing of genetic variation across porous species boundaries can facilitate adaptation to new environments and generate novel phenotypes, which may contribute to further diversification. Most Anopheles mosquito species that are of major importance as human malaria vectors have evolved within recent and rapid radiations of largely nonvector species. Here, we focus on one of the most medically important yet understudied anopheline radiations, the Afrotropical Anopheles funestus complex (AFC), to investigate the role of introgression in its diversification and the possible link between introgression and vector potential. The AFC comprises at least seven morphologically similar species, yet only An. funestus sensu stricto is a highly efficient malaria vector with a pan-African distribution. Based on de novo genome assemblies and additional whole-genome resequencing, we use phylogenomic and population genomic analyses to establish species relationships. We show that extensive interspecific gene flow involving multiple species pairs has shaped the evolutionary history of the AFC since its diversification. The most recent introgression event involved a massive and asymmetrical movement of genes from a distantly related AFC lineage into An. funestus, an event that predated and plausibly facilitated its subsequent dramatic geographic range expansion across most of tropical Africa. We propose that introgression may be a common mechanism facilitating adaptation to new environments and enhancing vectorial capacity in Anopheles mosquitoes.

Between 1998 and 2016, pine forests throughout the western United States experienced the largest and most destructive outbreak of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) on record, with most of the affected forests located on lands owned and managed by the U.S. government as national forests. Socio-political responses to this event in many geographies included the emergence of local to regional hybrid networks that provided direction and resources for responding to the disturbance event. In this study, we analyze the ability of governance networks to adapt in the face of the insect outbreak across four regional geographies: The Black Hills region of South Dakota and Wyoming; northern Colorado; northeastern Washington; and southwestern Montana. Specifically, we ask what factors accounted for divergent governance responses in the four cases and to what extent the emergent governance dynamics in each case facilitated lasting, long-term adaptation. Our results highlight governance trajectories as products of their respective histories and of feedback cycles among socio-political, institutional, and technological variables. By analyzing the origin, characteristics, and persistence of institutional change, this research contributes a comparative perspective on the adaptive potential of networks as functions of influences from multiple spatial and temporal scales.

J	Oliver, JC				Oliver, JC			Population genetic effects of human-mediated plant range expansions on native phytophagous insects	OIKOS			English	Article							DANAUS-CHRYSIPPUS L.; HERBIVOROUS INSECTS; EVOLUTION; ADAPTATION; FLOW; HYBRIDIZATION; CONSEQUENCES; SPECIATION; LANDSCAPE; ECOLOGY	Anthropogenic changes in organismal distributions have affected many, if not all, terrestrial ecosystems. Anthropogenic plant range expansions (APREs) may have profound effects on the population genetics of native phytophagous insects exploiting recent changes in plant distributions. Here I focus on the important, although often overlooked, effects on insect species which feed on such plants, but do not show evidence of host race formation. This article investigates geographic range expansion and increased interpopulation gene flow, which may occur as a result of phytophagous insects exploiting APREs. The two effects have clear predicted genetic signatures: (1) geographic range expansion should result in low levels of genetic diversity in new portions of the insect species' range, relative to older, pre-APRE portions of the range and (2) increased interpopulation gene flow will result in reduced population genetic differentiation. Data from the literature are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of one or both population genetic change scenarios. Higher order effects, such as reduced local adaptation, increased spread of resistance in agricultural systems, and hybridization among formerly isolated lineages, as evidenced by case studies, and the economic and conservation implications thereof are also discussed. Finally, I outline future approaches for addressing the impact of APREs on native phytophagous insect ecology and discuss the application of these concepts of population genetic change and resultant outcomes to research outside plant-insect interactions.

Contrasting patterns of hybridization in large house spiders (Tegenaria atrica group, Agelenidae)	EVOLUTION			English	Article						asymmetric introgression; GIS; hybrid zone; morphometrics; range expansion; reinforcement; speciation	EPHIPPIGER-EPHIPPIGER ORTHOPTERA; MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA VARIATION; HYBRID ZONE; CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; INTROGRESSION; SPECIATION; REINFORCEMENT; EVOLUTION; COLONIZATION	The integrity of species is not fixed and may vary geographically. Here we investigate the geographic distributions and interactions of species in the Tegenaria atrica group (Araneae: Agelenidae). Detailed mapping of T. saeva and T. gigantea in England and Wales shows them to be broadly allopatric in southern England with a tightly defined, and possibly long-standing, narrow zone of parapatry in central southern England. In the north of England (Yorkshire), by contrast, the species are broadly sympatric as a result of recent range expansions. GIS techniques are used to map the species distributions and to quantify, we believe for the first time, the intimacy of interspecific interactions. The extent and nature of hybridization in these two areas is examined through regression and multivariate analyses of morphology. We show that the relative incidence of hybridization is much greater in Yorkshire than within the parapatric zone in the south. Clear patterns of asymmetric introgression are observed in both northern and southern England, with a greater impact of T. gigantea on T. saeva than vice versa. We find no sign of morphological reproductive character displacement at the zone of parapatry that might indicate reinforcement, although we cannot exclude more subtle effects, for example via cuticular pheromones. The integrity of these two species seems to be breaking down in northern England, a process that might gain momentum as the gene pools become more similar.

These species are morphologically very similar, and are mainly distinguished by body colour differences. Here we assessed whether phenotypic divergence in coloration patterns define evolutionary units within the complex. We studied the phylogenetic relationships, demographic history and concordances between morphological and ecological traits in the group. The complex apparently had a demographic history of recent population expansion during the last glaciation period 75 000 to 9500 years ago. The three species show no reciprocal monophyly, and thus their allospecificity was not confirmed. The current distribution of haplotypes and the genetic divergences in these taxa can be explained by either recent mitochondrial introgression events caused by hybridisation or by incomplete lineage sorting. Colour pattern differences in the complex are not likely a product of local selection acting over a common genetic background. We suggest that phenotypic divergence in colour patterns during an incipient speciation process might be seen as an enhancing factor of cohesion within each of the three evolutionary units.

The COI data detected significant genetic differentiation among local populations of all three species, whereas the 28S data showed genetic differentiation only for L. seishinensis. The clearest differentiation of L. seishinensis among local populations was between the northern and southern regions in the COI clades, whereas the 28S clade, which likely indicates relatively ancient events, revealed a range expansion across the northern and southern regions. Leptocarabus semiopacus had the most shallow differentiation of the COI haplotypes, and some clades occurred across the northern and southern regions. In L. koreanus, four diverged COI clades occurred in different regions, with partial overlaps. We discuss the difference in phylogeographical patterns among these Leptocarabus species, as well as between these and other groups of carabid beetles in South Korea.

Characterizing patterns of introgressive hybridization between two species of Tyrannus following concurrent range expansion	IBIS			English	Article						hybrid fitness; hybrid zone; Scissor-tailed Flycatcher; Tyrannidae; Western Kingbird	MOSAIC HYBRID ZONE; SPECIATION; CONSERVATION; PASSERINE; EVOLUTION; SOFTWARE; CRICKETS; GENETICS; SURVIVAL; PROGRAM	Hybridization between two species typically occurs when allopatric or ecologically dissimilar species expand into areas of secondary contact or habitat transitions. However, as species' ranges shift rapidly in response to environmental change, the potential for novel types of ephemeral hybrid zones exists. Here, we document and describe the occurrence, prevalence and symmetry of a previously undocumented hybrid zone involving two sympatric, ecologically similar sister species that have been expanding their ranges eastward in the central USA: Scissor-tailed Flycatchers Tyrannus forficatus and Western Kingbirds Tyrannus verticalis. We identified cases of hybridization and introgression using analyses of eight microsatellite DNA loci and a single mitochondrial gene. We also evaluated short-term reproductive consequences of hybridization for both species by surveying for both species and potential hybrids at the periphery of their ranges in northeastern Arkansas and western Tennessee, USA. Genetic data revealed bi-directional backcrossing at the periphery of the species' ranges, including a cryptic hybrid. We also analysed DNA of putative 'pure' individuals from other parts of their ranges and detected two cryptic admixed individuals, suggesting backcrossed individuals from the periphery may be dispersing to breed or that hybridization events have occurred in the core. Finally, our results suggest that there are no short-term reproductive consequences of hybridization for the two species. In total, hybrid zones that occur at the edges of expanding, sympatric ranges may be ephemeral; we suggest they play an important role in introgression and may have long-standing impacts for sympatric sister species. Exploring the extent of hybrid zones such as this for other range-expanding taxa will elucidate whether this type of hybrid zone is unique or a common occurrence.

The hybrid zone between the two taxa is believed to have formed following range expansion at the end of the last glaciation and to be maintained by a balance between gene flow and selection against hybrids. Laboratory F1 hybrid males are sterile. We have examined morphological characters in two cols about 200 km apart and compared the positions and widths of clines for these characters both within and between cols. Clines are neither coincident (centred in the same position), nor concordant equal in width) in either col. Furthermore clines are wider and more dispersed in the western col. The lack of concordance can be explained on several models for the maintenance of the hybrid zone and is a common observation. There are many fewer examples of lack of coincidence and this result is more difficult to interpret. We suggest that it is due to a difference in population structure between the cols: a patchy distribution of grasshoppers in the western col produces wider, more dispersed clines while a sharp break in distribution in the eastern col tends to concentrate morphological change over a shorter distance.

A gall midge that induces leaf galls on Taraxacum species (Asteraceae) is identified as Cystiphora taraxaci (Kieffer). Another gall midge that is responsible for leaf galls on Sonchus brachyotus (Asteraceae) is described as a new species under the name Cystiphora hachijounae Yukawa and Kim based on its incised hypoproct of male terminalia and some of the pupal characteristics. Genetic analysis supported the species identifications and indicated that the Palearctic C. taraxaci has long existed in Japan. It has been diversifying geographically into intraspecific populations since at least 2.57 Ma. Our current study argues against the recent invasion of Japan by alien C. taraxaci at the time of multiple introductions of European Taraxacum species to Japan for use as food (seed oil), forage and greening material during the late 19th century. Genetic analysis of gall-bearing Taraxacum plants collected from various localities in Japan indicates that most of them were alien or hybrid plants, while native Japanese species were rare, and these plants exhibited polyploidy from 2x to 5x. Cystiphora taraxaci is considered to have expanded its host range from native Japanese to alien and hybrid species of Taraxacum without regard to polyploidy.

In Eastern Europe and Turkey, the lifecycle involves a sexual generation on Turkey oak, Quercus cerris, while in Iberia and North Africa the sexual generation host is cork oak, Q. suber. Over the last 500 years, A. kollari has expanded its range into northern Europe, following human planting of Q. cem's from Italy and the Balkans. We ask: (i) what is the genetic relationship between eastern and western distributions of Andricus kollari? Can we determine which lifecycle is ancestral, and how long ago they diverged? (ii) To what extent have eastern and western native ranges contributed to northwards range expansion? (iii) Is there any evidence for hybridization between the two life cycle types? We present analyses of allozyme data for 13 polymorphic loci and of sequence variation for a 433 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. These show: (i) that four haplotype lineages (one in Spain, two in Hungary/Italy and one in Turkey) diverged more or less simultaneously between 1 and 2 million years ago, suggesting the existence of at least four refuges through recent ice age cycles. Our data cannot resolve which lifecycle type is ancestral. (ii) Populations north of putative refuges are divided into two sets. Populations in south-west France are allied to Spain, while ail remaining populations in northern Europe have been colonized from Italy and the Balkans. (iii) The transition from one race to another in south-west France is marked by abrupt transitions in the frequency of refuge-specific private alleles and corresponds closely to the northern limit of the distribution of cork oak. Although hybrids were detected in north-west France, none were detected where the two lifecycles meet in south-western France. The biology of oak gallwasps predicts that any hybrid zone will be narrow and limited to regions where Q. cem's and Q. suber meet. Our data suggest that eastern and western A. kollari are effectively separate species.

Behavioural and genetic interactions between an endangered and a recently-arrived hummingbird	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS			English	Article						Contact zones; Eulidia yarrellii; Hummingbirds; Hybridisation; Resource competition; Thaumastura cora	HUACHUCA MOUNTAINS; FIRE ANT; COMPETITION; HYBRIDIZATION; TROCHILIDAE; DIAGNOSES; AVES; INVASIONS; DOMINANCE; OUTCOMES	The invasion or expansion of non-native species into new geographic areas can pose a major threat to the conservation of biodiversity. These threats are augmented when the newly-arrived species interacts with native species that are already threatened by other ecological or anthropogenic processes. Potential interactions can include both competition for scarce resources and reproductive interference, including hybridisation. Understanding the dynamics of these interactions forms a crucial component of conservation management strategies. A recent contact zone occurs in the north of Chile between the endangered Chilean woodstar (Eulidia yarrellii) and the closely-related and recently-arrived Peruvian sheartail (Thaumastura cora), which expanded its range from Peru into Chile during the 1970s. We characterised the interactions between the species by combining population size estimates with molecular, morphological and behavioural data. We show that a low degree of hybridisation, but not introgression, is occurring between the two species. Despite interspecific morphological similarities, behavioural observations indicate that food niche overlap between the species is relatively low, and that the dietary breadth of sheartails is larger, which may have aided the species' range expansion. Finally, woodstars dominate the sheartails in male-male territorial interactions. However, potentially increased energetic costs for woodstars associated with frequent territorial chases and courtship displaying with sheartails may exacerbate the effects of other threats on woodstar viability, such as human-induced habitat modification. This study highlights the value of implementing multidisciplinary approaches in conservation biology to gain a more complete understanding of interactions between recently-arrived and endangered species.

VUILL.; ELMS ULMUS SPP.; 1ST RECORD; WOODY-PLANTS; LARVAL HOSTS; HYBRIDIZATION; DISPERSAL; TAKEUKI; PUMILA	Although much research has been carried out to develop taxa resistant to Dutch elm disease (DED), newly occurring pests represent a new challenge for the protection of elms (Ulmacae). The invasive zigzag elm sawfly (Aproceros leucopoda) is a recent invader of Asian origin in Europe defoliating elm trees that are otherwise often characterized with major resistance to DED. The range expansion of this pest poses a major threat to elms. The aim of this study was to identify the susceptibility of Ulmus crassifolia, Hemiptelea davidii and Zelkova serrata to this pest by using three different methods (oviposition trials with cut shoots and with plants in pots, and larval feeding trials with plants in pots) to define the performance of A. leucopoda on potential hosts. The fact is that A. leucopoda was unable to complete its development on either of these three taxa of Ulmaceae, whereas Ulmus pumila (the reference during the trials) was again confirmed as a true host of the pest clearly indicating that the host plant range of A. leucopoda is probably limited not only to Ulmus but also within this genus. Our results may be considered in future resistance breeding programmes, pest risk assessments, and for the selection of Ulmaceae species.

The latter, again, will be influenced by the genetic structure of the host plant. Cirsium palustre (marsh thistle) is heavily infested by the tephritid fly Tephritis conura in northern Britain, whereas infestation is not only absent in southern England, but also absent on the European continent where T conura is common on other Cirsium. To understand why regional infestation patterns evolve, we studied how genetic structure and phylogeographic ancestry of C. palustre are related to the probability of infestation in Britain. The probability of infestation in Britain was related neither to phylogeographic lineage (two lineages were observed in Europe), nor to introgressive hybridization with the original host of T conura, C. heterophyllum. However, infested British C. palustre were strongly genetically deprived. British C. palustre showed continuous loss of genetic variability towards the northern range edge. The loss was explained best by genetic drift during geographic range expansion, rather than by genetic drift in isolated patches or mating system change from predominately outcrossing to selfing. The phylogeographic pattern of C. palustre strongly suggests Scotland as the geographic origin of a recent host-plant expansion of T conura.

Genetic Diversity and Thermal Performance in Invasive and Native Populations of African Fig Flies	MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						invasive species; genomics; genetic diversity; thermal performance; climate adaptation; Zaprionus	BALANCING SELECTION; RECOMBINATION RATE; DROSOPHILA; EVOLUTION; DIFFERENTIATION; HYBRIDIZATION; POLYMORPHISM; BOTTLENECKS; ADAPTATION; FITNESS	During biological invasions, invasive populations can suffer losses of genetic diversity that are predicted to negatively impact their fitness/performance. Despite examples of invasive populations harboring lower diversity than conspecific populations in their native range, few studies have linked this lower diversity to a decrease in fitness. Using genome sequences, we show that invasive populations of the African fig fly, Zaprionus indianus, have less genetic diversity than conspecific populations in their native range and that diversity is proportionally lower in regions of the genome experiencing low recombination rates. This result suggests that selection may have played a role in lowering diversity in the invasive populations. We next use interspecific comparisons to show that genetic diversity remains relatively high in invasive populations of Z. indianus when compared with other closely related species. By comparing genetic diversity in orthologous gene regions, we also show that the genome-wide landscape of genetic diversity differs between invasive and native populations of Z. indianus indicating that invasion not only affects amounts of genetic diversity but also how that diversity is distributed across the genome. Finally, we use parameter estimates from thermal performance curves for 13 species of Zaprionus to show that Z. indianus has the broadest thermal niche of measured species, and that performance does not differ between invasive and native populations. These results illustrate how aspects of genetic diversity in invasive species can be decoupled from measures of fitness, and that a broad thermal niche may have helped facilitate Z. indianus's range expansion.

We found 81 haplotypes from C. yamato. Of these, 17 haplotypes were considered to be of an introgressed lineage from C. albrechti, based on the phylogeny and geographic distribution. In addition, one haplotype of C. kimurai was likely an introgressant from C. yamato. Putative introgression events among the four species were restricted to these two directional cases. We analyzed the phylogeography of C. yamato using nested clade phylogeographical analysis and population genetic parameters. The mitochondrial lineages of C. yamato were estimated to have diverged no more than approximately 1.12 million years ago, implying that the estimated historical events occurred after the Early Pleistocene. Carabus yamato was inferred to have experienced a contraction of its distribution range, followed by recent range expansion. Populations in the western and eastern regions, segregated by Ise Bay and the Nobi and Okazaki Plains, diverged in the mitochondrial clades. The northern and most western populations possessed one clade only (except an introgressed lineage), whereas eastern and some southwestern populations possessed several diverged clades, which were considered to be ancestral; these populations may have been associated with refugia during glacial periods.

Here we use empirically collected thermal tolerance data in combination with molecular phylogenetics/phylogeography and ecological niche modelling to study the evolution of a clade of three western Mediterranean diving beetles, the Agabus brunneus complex. Results: The preferred mitochondrial DNA topology recovered A. ramblae (North Africa, east Iberia and Balearic islands) as paraphyletic, with A. brunneus (widespread in the southwestern Mediterranean) and A. rufulus (Corsica and Sardinia) nested within it, with an estimated origin between 0.60-0.25 Ma. All three species were, however, recovered as monophyletic using nuclear DNA markers. A Bayesian skyline plot suggested demographic expansion in the clade at the onset of the last glacial cycle. The species thermal tolerances differ significantly, with A. brunneus able to tolerate lower temperatures than the other taxa. The climatic niche of the three species also differs, with A. ramblae occupying more arid and seasonal areas, with a higher minimum temperature in the coldest month. The estimated potential distribution for both A. brunneus and A. ramblae was most restricted in the last interglacial, becoming increasingly wider through the last glacial and the Holocene. Conclusions: The A. brunneus complex diversified in the late Pleistocene, most likely in south Iberia after colonization from Morocco. Insular forms did not differentiate substantially in morphology or ecology, but A. brunneus evolved a wider tolerance to cold, which appeared to have facilitated its geographic expansion. Both A. brunneus and A. ramblae expanded their ranges during the last glacial, although they have not occupied areas beyond their LGM potential distribution except for isolated populations of A. brunneus in France and England. On the islands and possibly Tunisia secondary contact between A. brunneus and A. ramblae or A. rufulus has resulted in introgression. Our work highlights the complex dynamics of speciation and range expansions within southern areas during the last glacial cycle, and points to the often neglected role of North Africa as a source of European biodiversity.

The sites were detected by in situ hybridisation of labelled rDNA to chromosomal preparations. The total number of rDNA sites in an individual varied from three to thirteen. In the most extreme case, individuals from populations only 10 km apart had no rDNA loci in common. A survey of the geographical distribution of this variation identified clusters of populations with relatively similar chromosomal distribution of rDNA loci. These clusters correspond to those identified earlier by analysis of rDNA sequences. To explain this geographical clustering, we reconstructed the post-glacial colonisation of the region by assuming that the species' distribution has ascended to its current altitudinal range as the climate warmed. The reconstruction suggests that each cluster is descended from a colonisation route up a different alpine valley. That history would imply rapid establishment of rDNA differences, conceivably during the last 10 000 years since the last glaciation. The proposal for rapid change is consistent with the extensive within-population variation, which indicates that the processes responsible for the change in rDNA's chromosomal location continue to occur at a higher rate. We discuss whether our reconstruction of colonisation routes implies movement of the hybrid zone, which would indicate that a neo-XY sex chromosome system has spread through extant populations.

Adaptive evolutionary changes in cold tolerance can facilitate their establishment in new environments. Ambrosia artemisiifolia, a noxious invasive plant, occurs throughout China. Ophraella communa, a biological control agent of A. artemisiifolia, mainly occurs in southern China. However, in 2012, it established populations in Beijing (39.98 degrees N, 115.97 degrees E) following introduction from Laibin (23.62 degrees N, 109.37 degrees E), implying cold adaptation. The mechanisms underlying its rapid evolution of cold tolerance remain unknown. We investigated the levels of cryoprotectants and energy reserves in adult O. communa from two latitudes. In high-latitude insects, we found high trehalose, proline, glycerol, total sugar, and lipid levels; five potential genes (Tret1a, Tret1b, Tret1-2, P5CS, and GST), responsible for regulating cold tolerance and involved in trehalose transport, proline biosynthesis, and glutathione S-transferase activation, were highly expressed. These hybridisation changes could facilitate cold temperature adaptation. We demonstrate the genetic basis underlying rapid adaptation of cold tolerance in O. communa, explaining its extension to higher latitudes.

Genetic mixture of multiple source populations accelerates invasive range expansion	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						biological invasions; dispersal; genetic diversity; heterosis; spatial spread	PROPAGULE PRESSURE; EVOLUTION; DISPERSAL; SUCCESS; HYBRIDIZATION; ADMIXTURE; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; STOCHASTICITY; ADAPTATION	1. A wealth of population genetic studies have documented that many successful biological invasions stem from multiple introductions from genetically distinct source populations. Yet, mechanistic understanding of whether and how genetic mixture promotes invasiveness has lagged behind documentation that such mixture commonly occurs. We conducted a laboratory experiment to test the influence of genetic mixture on the velocity of invasive range expansion. 2. The mechanistic basis for effects of genetic mixture could include evolutionary responses (mixed invasions may harbour greater genetic diversity and thus elevated evolutionary potential) and/or fitness advantages of between-population mating (heterosis). If driven by evolution, positive effects of source population mixture should increase through time, as selection sculpts genetic variation. If driven by heterosis, effects of mixture should peak following first reproductive contact and then dissipate. 3. Using a laboratory model system (beetles spreading through artificial landscapes), we quantified the velocity of range expansion for invasions initiated with one, two, four or six genetic sources over six generations. Our experiment was designed to test predictions corresponding to the evolutionary and heterosis mechanisms, asking whether any effects of genetic mixture occurred in early or later generations of range expansion. We also quantified demography and dispersal for each experimental treatment, since any effects of mixture should be manifest in one or both of these traits. 4. Over six generations, invasions with any amount of genetic mixture (two, four and six sources) spread farther than single-source invasions. Our data suggest that heterosis provided a 'catapult effect', leaving a lasting signature on range expansion even though the benefits of outcrossing were transient. Individual-level trait data indicated that genetic mixture had positive effects on local demography (reduced extinction risk and enhanced population growth) during the initial stages of invasion but no consistent effects on dispersal ability. 5. Our work is the first to demonstrate that genetic mixture can alter the course of spatial expansion, the stage of invasion typically associated with the greatest ecological and economic impacts. We suggest that similar effects of genetic mixture may be a common feature of biological invasions in nature, but that these effects can easily go undetected.

In the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, critical photoperiod mediating the onset and maintenance of larval diapause has evolved about 10 standard deviations in mean critical photoperiod between the ancestral, Gulf Coast populations, and the derived, Canadian populations. We are seeking to understand how this evolution has been accomplished at both the genetic and the physiological levels. At the genetic level, average heterozygosity at protein-coding loci decreases with latitude of origin, while genetic variation for photoperiodic response increases with latitude of origin, particularly within the formerly glaciated regions of North America. Hybridization experiments reveal widespread genetic differences in critical photoperiod due to epistasis. We ascribe the increase in genetic variation in photoperiodic response, despite directional and stabilizing selection to the contrary, to the release of additive from epistatic variance during successive founder events in W. smithii's northward dispersal following recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, and to the resulting genetic drift and reorganization of genetic architectures in descendent populations. At the physiological level, northern populations of W. smithii, as well as northern populations of spider mites, flies, moths, and beetles in both North America and Europe show a declining expression of the rhythmic component of photoperiodic response. In Drosophila melanogaster, when the epistatic coupling between the period locus and photoperiodic response is disrupted, the critical photoperiod is shifted towards shorter daylengths; analogously in W. smithii, when epistatic interactions are disrupted in the recombining generations of hybrid populations, the critical photoperiod is shifted towards shorter daylengths. The implications here are (1) that in W. smithii, it is the epistatic modification of the photoperiodic response curve by the circadian clock that is being disrupted in the recombining generations and (2) that post-glacial range expansion into the North-Temperate Zone by arthropods in general may involve uncoupling of the circadian and photoperiodic clocks. Despite the tremendous advances that have been made in understanding circadian rhythmicity at the molecular level, virtually nothing is known about how or whether any of the downstream 'clock-controlled genes' connect with photoperiodic time measurement. Except in W. smithii, little is known about how this connection changes with seasonal adaptation of photoperiodic response through evolutionary time. It is our goal and desire that our top-clown approach to the evolution of photoperiodic time measurement will meet and mesh with the bottom-up approach that is being developed so fruitfully for circadian clocks.

Fitness variation across a subspecies border	EVOLUTION			English	Article						fitness components; local adaptation; range boundary; range expansion; range versus regional adaptation; reciprocal transplant	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY; HYBRID ZONE; NATURAL-SELECTION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; SELF-POLLINATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RANGE LIMITS; POPULATIONS; PHLOX; DIFFERENTIATION	Because the range boundary is the locale beyond which a taxon fails to persist, it provides a unique opportunity for studying the limits on adaptive evolution. Adaptive constraints on range expansion are perplexing in view of widespread ecotypic differentiation by habitat and region within a species' range (regional adaptation) and rapid evolutionary response to novel environments. In this Study of two parapatric subspecies, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. x. ssp. parviflora, we compared the fitness of population transplants within their native region, in a non-native region within the native range, and in the non-native range to assess whether range expansion might be limited by a greater intensity of selection on colonists of a new range versus a new region within the range. The combined range of the two subspecies spans a west-to-east gradient of declining precipitation in the Sierra Nevada of California, with ssp. xantiana in the west being replaced by ssp. parviflora in the east. Both Subspecies had significantly higher fitness in the native range (range adaptation), whereas regional adaptation was weak and was found only in the predominantly outcrossing ssp. xantiana but was absent in the inbreeding ssp. parviflora. Because selection intensity on transplants was Much stronger in the non-native range relative to non-native regions, there is a larger adaptive barrier to range versus regional expansion. Three of five sequential fitness components accounted for regional and range adaptation, but only one of them, survivorship from germination to flowering, contributed to both. Flower number contributed to regional adaptation in ssp. xantiana and fruit Set (number of fruits per flower) to range adaptation. Differential survivorship of the two taxa or regional Populations of ssp. xantiana in non-native environments was attributable. in part, to biotic interactions, including competition, herbivory, and pollination. For example. low fruit set in ssp. xantiana in the east was likely due to the absence of its principal specialist bee pollinators in ssp. parviflora's range. Thus, convergence on self-fertilization may be necessary for ssp. xantiana to invade ssp. parviflora's range. but the evolution of outcrossing would not be required for ssp. parviflora to invade ssp. xantiana's range.

These two species utilize the same sex attractant and pheromone traps capture both species. We estimated spread based on the ratio of the two species captured in pheromone-baited traps. Population boundaries were derived from captures in a grid of traps and spread was estimated as 6.6 km/year based on displacement of population boundaries between 2005 and 2008. Radial spread rate was also estimated as 6.9 km/year from the displacement of boundaries using logistic regression of trap captures along a single east-west transect of traps deployed yearly from 2007 to 2011. We also estimated the rate of spread from the expansion of defoliation mapped during aerial surveys. Based on the displacement of defoliation boundaries from 2005 to 2008, spread rate was estimated as 6.0 km/year. Based on the year of first defoliation, spread was estimated as 4.8 km/year and regression of the square-root of the cumulative area/pi versus time yielded an estimate of 4.7 km/year. All five estimates were similar, and differences reflect the nuances of the data from which they were derived. We discuss here how the occasional hybridization with O. bruceata may be either retarding or enhancing O. brumata spread.

Limited hybridization along a large contact zone between two genetic lineages of the butterfly Erebia medusa (Satyrinae, Lepidoptera) in Central Europe	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH			English	Article						contact zones; genetic lineages; postglacial range expansion; genetic diversity; allozyme electrophoresis; Nymphalidae	ICE AGES; CONSEQUENCES; QUATERNARY; EVOLUTIONARY; COLONIZATION; POPULATIONS; FLOW	Genetic lineages evolving during glacial isolation frequently come into contact as the result of postglacial range expansions. Hybridization often occurs along these contact zones. In Europe, the high mountain systems of the Alps and Pyrenees are well known for their hybrid belts. This article studies the contact zone of the Woodland Ringlet Erebia medusa in a Hercynian mountain area in the Czech-German border region not exceeding 1500 m a.s.l. Hybrid populations between an eastern and a western genetic lineage were detected by AMOVA-based tests, principal component analysis and neighbour joining analysis. Over most of the range of the Czech-German Border Mts, the ridges separate the western and the eastern genetic lineage from each other. However, two important hybrid areas were detected: (1) the watershed of the Ohre river in the north-west of that area, a major valley system passing through these mountains and (2) the high plateaux of the Sumava Mts in the south-east, an extended area of high elevation. The location of hybrid populations in geographical vicinity to non-hybrid populations and the generally low F-IS (2.1%) make reduced fitness of hybrid individuals little likely. The hybrid populations have intermediate genetic diversity between the genetically poor western and the genetically rich eastern lineage populations.

In north-central Alberta, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb) form a complex and poorly defined hybrid zone. Better knowledge of this zone is relevant, given the recent host expansion of mountain pine beetle into jack pine. We characterized the zone by genotyping 1998 lodgepole, jack pine, and hybrids from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Minnesota at 11 microsatellites. Using Bayesian algorithms, we calculated genetic ancestry and used this to model the relationship between species occurrence and environment. In addition, we analyzed the ancestry of hybrids to calculate the genetic contribution of lodgepole and jack pine. Finally, we measured the amount of gene flow between the pure species. We found the distribution of the pine classes is explained by environmental variables, and these distributions differ from classic distribution maps. Hybrid ancestry was biased toward lodgepole pine; however, gene flow between the two species was equal. The results of this study suggest that the hybrid zone is complex and influenced by environmental constraints. As a result of this analysis, range limits should be redefined.

The phylogeography of Calobius quadricollis and C. urbanelliae, two sibling species of moss beetles (Coleoptera, Hydraenidae) inhabiting Italian temporary marine rock-pool ecosystems, were studied using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Our data suggest a strong association between the scored genetic variability and the geographical distribution of populations sampled for both species. These analyses provided evidences of episodic species range expansion and fragmentation, recurrent "flush and crash" and bottleneck episodes probably occurring during the Glacial Cycles. The observed phylogeographical pattern is probably related to the historical and biogeographical processes of Mediterranean areas, as well as both to the ephemeral habitat tipology and limited dispersal ability of these beetles.

The western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is historically a pest of both corn (Zea mays L. (Poales: Poaceae)) and dry beans (Phaseolus sp. L. (Fabales: Fabaceae)) in the western Great Plains. However, it has recently undergone an eastward range expansion establishing itself across the Corn Belt in 25 states and 4 Canadian provinces.To mitigate the effects of infestation in Michigan, foliar insecticides are used in dry beans, whereas management of the pest in corn relies more heavily on the use of Bt-expressing hybrids. In this study stable carbon isotope analysis was used to determine what crop adult moths developed on as larvae with analysis showing that very few of the adult moths developed on dry beans. These results suggest that beans and corn are not suitable as co-refuges and that mainly adults which developed on corn are contributing to the next generation of western bean cutworm in Michigan.

J	Schmitt, T; Besold, J				Schmitt, Thomas; Besold, Joachim			Upslope movements and large scale expansions: the taxonomy and biogeography of the Coenonympha arcania- C-d arwiniana- C-gardetta butterfly species complex	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						allozyme electrophoresis; alpine endemics; cladogenesis; Coenonympha macromma; Coenonympha pamphilus; hybridization; interspecific differentiation; Lepidoptera; molecular biogeography; phylogeography	POLYOMMATUS-CORIDON LEPIDOPTERA; GLACIAL REFUGIA; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENETIC CONSEQUENCES; SOUTHERN EUROPE; ICE AGES; NYMPHALIDAE; DIFFERENTIATION; LYCAENIDAE; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY	Sibling species groups are suitable models for the understanding of inter and intraspecific processes in taxonomy and biogeography We analysed 262 individuals from the Alps of the Coenonympha arcania Igardetta species complex by allozyme electrophoresis. These taxa showed high variance amongst populations (Fsr. 0.391) and strong intertaxon genetic differentiation (FCT: 0.376). Although morphologically similar, Coenonympha gardetta and Coenonympha arcania clearly differ in their genetic characteristics; the morphologically intermediate taxa Coenonympha darwiniana darwiniana and Coenonympha darwiniana macromma are genetically well distinguished from each other and the two other taxa. Coenonympha area nia and C. d. macromma most probably share a common ancestor and evolved by cladogenesis, whereas the taxonomic situation of C d darwiniana is still unresolved: This taxon might be the result of hybridization between C. arcania and C. gardetta or it might have a common ancestor together with C, gardetta. We suggest species rank for all four taxa. The distribution of genetic diversity of these populations and the differentiation amongst populations suggest rather different hiogeographical scenarios: C. arcania most probably is of Mediterranean origin with postglacial range expansion northwards; C gardetta survived the last ice age in peripheral refugia of the Alps and has spread all over this high mountain system in the postglacial; C. darwiniana and C. macromma survived the Wurm in geographic proximity to their actual distribution areas and only have performed moderate uphill translocations during postglacial warming.

Abiotically-Induced Plant Morphological Changes and Host-Range Expansion in Quarantine Evaluations of Candidate Weed Biocontrol Agents: The Case Study Conchyloctenia hybrida (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						growth condition; plant-herbivore interaction; Solanum species; trichome; tortoise beetle	BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL AGENT; CARBON-NUTRIENT BALANCE; HERBIVORY; SHADE; SOLANACEAE; CASSIDINAE; TRICHOMES; DEFENSE; SPECIFICITY; PUBESCENCE	Plant morphological changes mediated by growth conditions are linked to changes in host preference of herbivores. Understanding how these morphological changes influence herbivore feeding is critical in the interpretation of results of host evaluation of candidate weed biocontrol agents in quarantine and improvement of the evaluation system. We determined the effect of plant growth conditions on leaf trichomes and host choice of Conchyloctenia hybrida Boheman, an insect adapted to the removal of trichomes before feeding. The study included four Solanum species: Solanum lichtensteinii Willdenow (natural host of C. hybrida), Solanum mauritianum Scopoli, Solanum melongena L., and Solanum tuberosum L.. Plants were grown in either full sun, shade, a glasshouse, or in a growth-chamber. Plants grown in full sun had a higher leaf trichome density than those in shade or controlled environments. S. mauritianum had the highest trichome density and thickness of trichome layer. In a multiple-choice test using excised leaves, feeding by C. hybrida was higher on Solanum plants grown in the controlled environment as compared with full sun. Trichome removal from leaf surfaces of plants grown in full sun, using adhesive tape, was effective for S. lichtensteinii, S. mauritianum, and S. melongena, but not S. tuberosum. Leaf consumption by C. hybrida increased significantly where manual trichome removal using adhesive tape was effective. Structurally, leaves of S. tuberosum have simple trichomes with basal cells sunken into the mesophyll tissue. When using forceps to remove trichomes of S. tuberosum, mesophyll and vascular tissue remained attached to the trichomes. Generally, the type, density, and mat-thickness of leaf trichomes determined feeding by C. hybrida, but varied with plant species and growth conditions.

Four main lineages are observed within Meladema, representing the three recognized species plus Corsican populations of M. coriacea. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate the sister relationship of the two Atlantic Island taxa, and suggest the possible paraphyly of M. coriacea. A molecular clock approach reveals that speciation within the genus occurred in the Early Pleistocene, indicating that the Atlantic Island endemics are not Tertiary relict taxa as had been proposed previously. Our results point to past population bottlenecks in all four lineages, with recent (Late-Middle Pleistocene) range expansion in non-Corsican M. coriacea and M. imbricata. Within the Canary Islands, M. imbricata seems to have independently colonized La Gomera and La Palma from Tenerife (although a colonization of La Palma from La Gomera cannot be discarded), and M. coriacea has independently colonized Tenerife and Gran Canaria from separate mainland lineages. In the Mediterranean basin this species apparently colonized Corsica on a single occasion, relatively early in its evolutionary history (Early Pleistocene), and has colonized Mallorca recently on multiple occasions. On the only island where M. coriacea and M. imbricata are broadly sympatric (Tenerife), we report evidence of bidirectional hybridization between the two species.

BIOCONTROL			English	Article						Alien species; Biological control agent; Environmental risk assessment; Exotic species; Invasive species; Non-target effects	RISK-ASSESSMENT; HYMENOPTERA; PHYLOGEOGRAPHY; CYNIPIDAE	The chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus is a global pest of chestnut (Castanea spp). Established as a pest in the mid-twentieth century in Japan, Korea and North America, this species was first reported in Europe in 2002. Following the successful release of a biological control agent Torymus sinensis in Japan, this parasitoid species has been released in Italy since 2005. Here we discuss the potential of T. sinensis as a viable management option for the biological control of D. kuriphilus in central Europe. We suggest that more consideration should be given to determining, (i) the conditions under which T. sinensis may attack alternative native gall wasp hosts and (ii) the likelihood of hybridization of this species with native Torymus. Both issues are central to predicting unassisted range expansion by released T. sinensis, and to assess the environmental risks associated with a more widespread release of this species in Europe.

Geographic Distribution of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1F Toxin Resistance in Western Bean Cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Populations in the United States	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						insecticidal protein toxin; resistance	ALBICOSTA SMITH LEPIDOPTERA; FIELD-EVOLVED RESISTANCE; TRANSGENIC CORN HYBRIDS; ECONOMIC INJURY LEVELS; INSECT RESISTANCE; SEED MIXTURES; SPODOPTERA-FRUGIPERDA; BT MAIZE; RANGE EXPANSION; SURVIVAL	The western bean cutworm (WBC), Striacosta albicosta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), can be a severe pest of transgenic corn in the western Plains and Great Lakes regions of North America, including on hybrids expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1F toxin. The level and geographic distribution of Cry1F resistance are not completely known. Neonate S. albicosta from 10 locations between Nebraska and New York state were subjected to dose-response trypsin-activated native Cry1F toxin overlay bioassays. In 2017, the mean estimated lethal concentration causing 50% larval mortality (LC50) ranged from 15.1 to 18.4 mu g Cry1F cm(-2), and were not significantly different among locations. In 2018, LC50 estimates at Scottsbluff, NE (22.0 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)) and Watertown, NY (21.7 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)) were significantly higher when compared to locations in Michigan (15.8 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)). Significantly lower 14-day larval weight among survivors was correlated with higher Cry1F dose. Results from this study indicate that S. albicosta survivorship on purified Bt Cry1F toxin shows a relatively even distribution across the native and range expansion areas where seasonal field infestations typically occur.

Incipient speciation events are particularly useful to follow such processes that are not tractable when considering well-differentiated taxa. A promising case study was discovered in the pine processionary moth, Thaumetopoea pityocampa, a Mediterranean defoliator of Pinus species, for which allochrony acting as an automatic magic trait was recognized as the major driver of an incipient speciation process. In Portugal, a unique population with a shifted phenology, known as the summer population (SP), co-occurs with a population following the typical life cycle, known as the winter population (WP). We monitored male activity of both populations in the Leiria region, i.e. over the whole SP distribution range using a systematic sampling along two transects, and studied Portuguese WPs at a larger geographical scale to explore their genetic diversity and spatial pattern of differentiation. Results showed that the WPs were genetically more diverse than the SP, with a strong pattern of isolation by distance both at large and small spatial scales, while the SP was very homogeneous over its whole range, without signature of its recent spatial expansion. Contrary to our expectations, no F1 hybrids were identified, even though we found an extended flight period of the SP, overlapping with the beginning of the WP reproductive period. Interestingly, the SP was found to be mostly limited to the sea shore where the WP is now scarce or absent, which could suggest competitive exclusion. Once clearly occurring in a sympatric context, the allochronic differentiation tends to develop nowadays in parapatry.

F. occidentalis, which is endemic to North America, was initially detected in Kunming in southwestern China in 2000 and since then it has rapidly invaded several other localities in China where it has greatly damaged greenhouse vegetables and ornamental crops. Controlling this invasive pest in China requires an understanding of its genetic makeup and migration patterns. Using the mitochondrial COI gene and 10 microsatellites, eight of which were newly isolated and are highly polymorphic, we investigated the genetic structure and the routes of range expansion of 14 F. occidentalis populations in China. Both the mitochondrial and microsatellite data revealed that the genetic diversity of F. occidentalis of the Chinese populations is lower than that in its native range. Two previously reported cryptic species (or ecotypes) were found in the study. The divergence in the mitochondrial COI of two Chinese cryptic species (or ecotypes) was about 3.3% but they cannot be distinguished by nuclear markers. Hybridization might produce such substantial mitochondrial-nuclear discordance. Furthermore, we found low genetic differentiation (global F-ST = 0.043, P<0.001) among all the populations and strong evidence for gene flow, especially from the three southwestern populations (Baoshan, Dali and Kunming) to the other Chinese populations. The directional gene flow was further supported by the higher genetic diversity of these three southwestern populations.

ASSORTATIVE MATING AND SPATIAL STRUCTURE IN HYBRID ZONES	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Assortative mating; dispersal; hybrid zones; long distance; mosaic	CHORTHIPPUS-JACOBSI ORTHOPTERA; DISTANCE SEED DISPERSAL; IN-GROUND CRICKETS; MYTILUS-GALLOPROVINCIALIS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; RANGE EXPANSION; FEMALE CHOICE; HABITAT; SELECTION; SPECIATION	The spatial genetic composition of hybrid zones exhibits a range of possible patterns, with many characterized by patchy distributions. While several hypothetical explanations exist for the maintenance of these "mosaic" hybrid zones, they remain virtually unexplored theoretically. Using computer simulations we investigate the roles of dispersal and assortative mating in the formation and persistence of hybrid zone structure. To quantify mosaic structure we develop a likelihood method, which we apply to simulation and empirical data. We find that long distance dispersal can lead to a patchy distribution that assortative mating can then reinforce, ultimately producing a mosaic capable of persisting over evolutionarily significant periods of time. By reducing the mating success of rare males, assortative mating creates a positive within-patch frequency-dependent selective pressure. Selection against heterozygotes can similarly create a rare-type disadvantage and we show that it can also preserve structure. We find that mosaic structure is maintained across a range of assumptions regarding the form and strength of assortative mating. Interestingly, we find that higher levels of mosaic structure are sometimes observed for intermediate assortment strengths. The high incidence of assortment documented in hybrid zones suggests that it may play a key role in stabilizing their form and structure.

Two recombinant hybrid baculoviruses containing cDNA of the porcine precursor IL-18 and the porcine caspase-1 were constructed and were used to infect silkworm larvae. After the co-infection of the two viruses, porcine mature IL-18 was efficiently produced in the haemolymph. The concentration of IL-18 in the haemolymph was 80-100 mug/ml, as determined by porcine IL-18 specific ELISA. This yield was twenty-times more than that of the insect cell expression system described previously. The porcine mature IL-18 produced by the silkworms strongly induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production from porcine PBMC. An insect factory system for the large-scale production of useful cytokines for livestock animals will be available in the near future.

Although traditional parsimony tree construction generally failed to resolve interspecific relationships and construct biologically meaningful genealogies, analysis using statistical parsimony networks yielded statistically significant inter- and intraspecific genealogical structures. We found that although these two species represent a notable case of trans-species polymorphisms in both mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, their status as separate species was evidenced by the nonrandom association between species and nested clades at various nesting levels. The exceptional occurrence of shared identical or very similar COI sequences was considered to be the result of introgressive hybridization. In addition, range expansion and fragmentation events across the Korean Peninsula and adjacent islands were inferred from nested clade phylogeographical analyses. The COI gene revealed the geographical divergence of major eastern and western clades and historical biogeographical events within each major clade, whereas the nuclear PepCK gene, which did not reveal corresponding east west clades, indicated past fragmentation and range expansion across wide areas that may have been the result of older biogeographical events. Thus, phylogeographical inferences drawn from analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes can reveal different and potentially complementary information about phylogeographical processes.

Plant-herbivore coevolution and plant speciation	ECOLOGY			English	Article						plant defense; plant-herbivore coevolution; plant-insect cospeciation; speciation; vicariance	ECOLOGICAL SPECIATION; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; SYMPATRIC SPECIATION; DEFENSE SYNDROMES; GENETIC-BASIS; HYBRID ZONES; HOST SHIFTS; ESCALATION; COMMUNITY; DIVERSIFICATION	More than five decades ago, Ehrlich and Raven proposed a revolutionary idea-that the evolution of novel plant defense could spur adaptive radiation in plants. Despite motivating much work on plant-herbivore coevolution and defense theory, Ehrlich and Raven never proposed a mechanism for their "escape and radiate" model. Recent intriguing mechanisms proposed by Marquis et al. include sympatric divergence, pleiotropic effects of plant defense traits on reproductive isolation, and strong postzygotic isolation, but these may not be general features of herbivore-mediated speciation. An alternate view is that herbivores may impose strong divergent selection on defenses in allopatric plant populations, with plant-herbivore coevolution driving local adaptation resulting in plant speciation. Building on these ideas, we propose three scenarios that consider the role of herbivores in plant speciation. These include (1) vicariance, subsequent coevolution within populations and adaptive divergence between geographically isolated populations, (2) colonization of a new habitat lacking effective herbivores followed by loss of defense and then re-evolution and coevolution of defense in response to novel herbivores, and (3) evolution of a new defense followed by range expansion, vicariance, and coevolution. We discuss the general role of coevolution in plant speciation and consider outstanding issues related to understanding: (1) the mechanisms behind cospeciation of plants and insects, (2) geographic variation in defense phenotypes, (3) how defensive traits and geography map on plant phylogenies, and (4) the role of herbivores in driving character displacement in defense phenotypes of related species in sympatry.

Given the heterogeneity of the environment, and indications of local adaptation, there are many unknowns regarding the response of these forests to future outbreaks. To better understand this we aim to identify genetic regions that have adaptive potential. We used data collected on 472 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci from 576 tree samples collected across 13 lodgepole pine-dominated sites and four jack pine-dominated sites. We looked at the relationship of genetic diversity with the environment, and we identified candidate loci using both frequency-based (ARLEQUIN and BAYESCAN) and correlation-based (MATSAM and BAYENV) methods. We found contrasting relationships between environmental variation and genetic diversity for the species. While we identified a number of candidate outliers (34 in lodgepole pine, 25 in jack pine, and 43 interspecific loci), we did not find any loci in common between lodgepole and jack pine. Many of the outlier loci identified were correlated with environmental variation. Using rigorous criteria we have been able to identify potential outlier SNPs. We have also found evidence of contrasting environmental adaptations between lodgepole and jack pine which could have implications for beetle spread risk.	[Cullingham, Catherine I.; Cooke, Janice E.

In this study, we analysed the Chalk-hill Blue Polyommatus coridon all along the contact zone of two expansive lineages. This zone stretches from the sandy areas of north-eastern Germany, along the mountain ranges of the GermanCzech border and throughout the eastern Alps. We studied allozymes (19 loci) of 38 populations (1542 individuals) and compared these data sets against 15 populations of the western and 15 populations of the eastern lineages and found different degrees of hybridization. Thus, the calcareous regions of Thuringia and Sachsen-Anhalt were mostly colonized by the western lineage. The middle mountain ranges between Bavaria and Bohemia represented a strong barrier blocking further expansion and thus completely impeding hybridization in this region. More intense hybridization was detected in the populations of the eastern Alps, especially in the north-eastern part, where the Danube most probably acted as an expansion corridor for both lineages followed by intensive hybridization. In the south-eastern Alps, hybrid populations were mostly detected in the easternmost parts and along the larger river valley of Drava and Mur; pure western populations dominated in the other areas of this region. These results show that the degree of hybridization along a contact zone is correlated with the ecological demands of a species and the regional physical geographic circumstances. This finding was proved for the Chalk-hill Blue in our study but is also the most likely scenario in most animal and plant species.

However, since the initiation of an eastward range expansion of S. albicosta in the late 1990s, economic damage has been observed in the Midwest, and the species has now reached the Atlantic Coast and Quebec. Economic damage to corn occurs by larval feeding on ears, which is not controlled by commercial transgenic hybrids that express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1Ab, but partial control is observed by corn varieties that express Cry1 F toxins. Inadequate protocols for laboratory rearing of S. albicosta have hindered controlled efficacy experimentation in the laboratory and field. We report an S. albicosta rearing methodology used to maintain a laboratory colony for 12 continuous generations. Rearing procedures were adapted for Bt toxin diet-overlay assays, revealing that S. albicosta larvae exposed to Bt toxin for 14 d were insensitive to Cry1Ab concentrations up to 25,000 ng/cm(2). In contrast, neonates exposed to Cry1 F toxin at >= 250 ng/cm(2), showed reduced developmental rates, with estimated effective concentrations of EC50 = 1,187.5 ng/cm(2) and EC95 = 10,000.5 ng/cm(2). The ability to mass produce this pest insect will enhance fundamental research, including evaluation of control tactics and toxin susceptibility.

DNA-based approaches may be used to test if these groups in fact represent historically divided, discrete species entities. The Cicindela hybrida complex (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae) is an assemblage of up to seven morphologically recognized species and 15 subspecies with wide distribution in the Palaearctic region. We sequenced a discontinuous segment of 1899 bp of mtDNA including three regions (coxI, rrnL+trnL2+nad1, cob) for a total of 99 specimens from 36 sampling localities across Europe, revealing 48 haplotypes. Four major clades could be identified corresponding to geographical groups from central Iberia, Ukraine, central Europe, and a band from the Atlantic Iberian coast to northern Europe. Taking into account further subdivisions within these clades, four of the six named species included in the analysis were recognizable by applying various procedures for species delimitation. Age estimates from calibrated molecular clocks date the diversification of the hybrida group within the past 2 million years (Myr), and the separation of the northern clade within 0.4 Myr. Nested clade analysis revealed the rapid range expansion of the northern group consistent with postglacial dispersal, but we did not find support for specific source population(s) in the postulated southern refugia. The evolutionary framework based on mtDNA sequences is shown to identify species entities as discrete clusters of closely related sequences and provides an objective system for delineating and recognizing hierarchically structured groups. In the case of the C. hybrida complex, these groups largely coincided with those established from morphology. The study adds further support to the utility of mtDNA-based sequence profiles (the 'DNA taxonomy') as a rapid and objective synthesis of evolutionary diversity and as reference system for communication.

The genus is found predominantly in moist temperate montane grassland and has its centre of diversity in the Drakensberg region of southern Africa. The genus has a complex alpha taxonomy and species relationships are poorly understood. Using a multiple exemplar approach, DNA sequence data from the chloroplast trnT-L spacer and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region were used in ail attempt to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Five cpDNA lineages were recovered, the geographic distributions of which correspond Well with previously identified Afromontane centres of diversity and endemism. The data revealed that several morpho-species were non-monophyletic, and this, together with short branch lengths and many identical sequences within each of the five lineages, Suggests a recent radiation. We additionally propose that hybridisation and/or incomplete lineage sorting may also account for this result. The nrlTS region was largely uninformative as many taxa and samples had identical sequences. We hypothesise that Kniphofia experienced periods of range expansion, secondary contact and hybridisation during Pleistocene glacial periods, followed by contraction, fragmentation and isolation in montane refugia during the warmer interglacial periods.

Species delimitation and invasion history of the balsam woolly adelgid, Adelges (Dreyfusia) piceae (Hemiptera: Aphidoidea: Adelgidae), species complex	SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article							APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; RANGE EXPANSION; DNA-SEQUENCE; HOMOPTERA; EVOLUTION; RATZEBURG; SOFTWARE; NORTHERN; BIOLOGY	The Adelges (Dreyfusia) piceae (Ratzeburg) species complex is a taxonomically unstable group of six species. Three of the species are cyclically parthenogenetic [Ad. nordmannianae (Eckstein), Ad. prelli (Grossmann), and Ad. merkeri (Eichhorn)] and three are obligately asexual [Ad. piceae, Ad. schneideri (Borner), and Ad. nebrodensis (Binazzi & Covassi)]. Some species are high-impact pests of fir (Abies) trees, so stable species names are needed to communicate effectively about management. Therefore, to refine species delimitation, guided by a reconstruction of their biogeographic history, we genotyped adelgids from Europe, North America, and the Caucasus Mountains region with 19 microsatellite loci, sequenced the COI DNA barcoding region, and compared morphology. Discriminant analysis of principal components of microsatellite genotypes revealed four distinct genetic clusters. Two clusters were morphologically consistent with Ad. nordmannianae. One of these clusters consisted of samples from the Caucasus Mountains and northern Turkey, and the other included samples from this region as well as from Europe and North America, where Ad. nordmannianae is invasive. A third cluster was morphologically consistent with Ad. piceae, and included individuals from Europe, where it is native, and North America, where it is invasive. In North America, the majority of Ad. piceae individuals were assigned to two geographically widespread clones, suggesting multiple introductions. The fourth cluster included individuals morphologically consistent with Ad. prelli or Ad. merkeri. However, based on genetic assignments, hybrid simulations, and approximate Bayesian computation, we find it likely that these are contemporary hybrids between Ad. nordmannianae and Ad. piceae that arose independently in Europe and North America, so we propose that Ad. prelli and Ad. merkeri are invalid. Finally, we synonymise Ad. schneideri (syn.n.) with Ad. nordmannianae and designate Ad. nebrodensis as subspecies Ad. piceae nebrodensis (stat.n.). Our revised taxonomy therefore recognises two species: Ad. nordmannianae and Ad. piceae, which we estimate to have diverged recently, during one of the last two interglacial periods. Finally, we comment on this species complex being in the midst of transition between sexual and asexual reproduction, a pattern that is probably common in Adelgidae.

Here, we show a possible example in which a species-specific anti-viral response may drive phylogenic divergence in insect virus evolution. Two baculoviruses, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV), have a high degree of DNA sequence similarity, but exhibit non-overlapping host specificity. In our study of their host-range determination, we found that BmNPV replication in B. mori cells was prevented by AcMNPV-P143 (AcP143), but not BmNPV-P143 (BmP143) or a hybrid P143 protein from a host-range expanded phenotype. This suggests that AcMNPV resistance in B. mori cells depends on AcP143 recognition and that BmNPV uses BmP143 to escapes this recognition. Based on these data, we propose an insectbaculovirus co-evolution scenario in which an ancestor of silkworms exploited an AcMNPVresistant mechanism; AcMNPV counteracted this resistance via P143 mutations, resulting in the birth of BmNPV.

Those screened included the mycophagous species D, falleni, D. recens, D. phalerata, D. testacea, D. neotestacea, D. orientacea, D, putrida and D. tripunctata, and the nonmycophagous species D. palustris and D. quinaria. Two species, D. recens and D. orientacea, were found to be infected with Wolbachia. Subsequent tests of four additional strains of D. recens found all to be infected with the bacteria. It was established that these bacteria cause partial cytoplasmic incompatibility in D. recens by antibiotic curing followed by crosses between cured and uncured strains. Curing was confirmed by a PCR assay. Although most species of insects shown to be infected with Wolbachia are cosmopolitan and/or have undergone recent range expansion in association with human activity, D. recens and D, orientacea are endemic species with specialized ecological habits. Preliminary molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that, among the species we examined, D. quinaria is most closely related to D, recens. To determine whether the bacteria are involved in reproductive isolation between these two species, reciprocal crosses were carried out between D. quinaria and both infected and uninfected (cured) strains of D. recens. Although these species did mate with each other, all interspecific crosses failed to yield hybrid progeny, indicating that the bacteria are not responsible for reproductive incompatibility between these species.

The inexorable spread of a newly arisen neo-Y chromosome	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							GRASSHOPPER PODISMA-PEDESTRIS; SEX-CHROMOSOMES; DOSAGE COMPENSATION; X-CHROMOSOME; HYBRID ZONES; EVOLUTION; ADAPTATION; FITNESS; ORIGIN; RECOMBINATION	A newly arisen Y-chromosome can become established in one part of a species range by genetic drift or through the effects of selection on sexually antagonistic alleles. However, it is difficult to explain why it should then spread throughout the species range after this initial episode. As it spreads into new populations, it will actually enter females. It would then be expected to perform poorly since it will have been shaped by the selective regime of the male-only environment from which it came. We address this problem using computer models of hybrid zone dynamics where a neo-XY chromosomal race meets the ancestral karyotype. Our models consider that the neo-Y was established by the fusion of an autosome with the ancestral X-chromosome (thereby creating the Y and the 'fused X'). Our principal finding is that sexually antagonistic effects of the Y induce indirect selection in favour of the fused X-chromosomes, causing their spread. The Y-chromosome can then spread, protected behind the advancing shield of the fused X distribution. This mode of spread provides a robust explanation of how newly arisen Y-chromosomes can spread. A Y-chromosome would be expected to accumulate mutations that would cause it to be selected against when it is a rare newly arrived migrant. The Y can spread, nevertheless, because of the indirect selection induced by gene flow (which can only be observed in models comprising multiple populations). These results suggest a fundamental re-evaluation of sex-chromosome hybrid zones. The well-understood evolutionary events that initiate the Y-chromosome's degeneration will actually fuel its range expansion.

Throwing Out the Bathwater but Keeping the Baby: Lessons Learned from Purple Loosestrife and Reed Canarygrass	HORTTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						evolution; herbaceous ornamentals; invasive species	GRASS PHALARIS-ARUNDINACEA; LYTHRUM-SALICARIA L; INVASIVE PLANTS; PROPAGULE PRESSURE; WETLAND PLANTS; POPULATIONS; L.; ESTABLISHMENT; POLLINATION; LYTHRACEAE	Historic ignorance of species' native range, expansion due to unintentional involvement by vectors, and their quiet evolution has caused several invasive species to become "poster children," such as purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea), and others. Common misconceptions on how these became problematic have involved a variety of causes, including ignorance of species' ability to intercross and create introgressive hybrids, lack of insects for control, wind pollination, and intercontinental distribution from their native range. Current research focuses on how misappropriating the historical contexts can reverse our misconceptions of native species being noninvasive and how this affects control by land managers. Purple loosestrife and reed canarygrass will be used as example species to demonstrate challenges that native vs. exotic, intra-, and interspecific differences confer to land managers. Issues such as a lack of phenotypic differences challenge land managers' charge to control invasive individuals yet retain the noninvasives. This is fraught with challenges when native vs. exotic status is invoked or cultural values are entwined. To avoid a monumental impasse, particularly when native and exotic types are phenotypically indistinguishable, this dilemma could be solved via modern techniques using molecular biology.

Besides these areas, these cactophilic species are also found in a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast from northeastern Brazil to the southern tip of the country. The hypothesis of vicariant events, defining the core areas of each species, is proposed to explain the historical diversification for the cluster. The intraspecific analysis for the cluster shows a population structure with gene flow restricted by distance, range expansion with secondary contact resulting in introgression and simpatry, especially in the limits of the species distribution, polytypic populations and assortative mating in inter population experiments. There is a variation related to these events that depends on the species and geographic origin of the population analyzed. These events are, hypothetically, described as the results of expansion and retraction of the population ranges, as a consequence of their association with cacti, which theoretically follow the expansion and retraction of dry areas during the paleoclimatic oscillations in South America, as that promoted by the glacial cycles of the Quaternary. The Drosophila buzzatii cluster is divided into two groups. The first one is composed of D. buzzatii, a species that has a broad geographic distribution and no significant differentiation between its populations. The second is the Drosophila serido sibling set, which encompasses the others species and is characterized by a significant potential for differentiation.

We model the invasion of new territory by genetically distinct populations of the same species to investigate the dynamics of such episodes. If long distance dispersal is sufficiently frequent, the populations do not spread as a wave of advance but instead found intermingled isolates. We argue that this process can explain many otherwise puzzling patterns in the geographical distribution of alleles.

Greuter & Burdet that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Coincya monensis is represented in the British flora by two subspecies; ssp. monensis is a diploid, endemic taxon largely confined to open, coastal, sand dune habitats along the west coast of Britain; ssp. cheiranthos is a tetraploid neophyte (alien) of ruderal and coastal habitats. Both subspecies occur as short-lived perennials in outbreeding, insect-pollinated populations in open, early successional communities. Individuals may perennate as hemicryptophytes with buds in basal rosettes or as chamaephytes with buds in aerial shoot rosettes, but adequate seed production is essential for the long-term maintenance of populations. Seed production by the much larger and more floriferous tetraploid alien populations is much greater than that of the native endemic populations. Neither subspecies is able to compete effectively in late successional, grassland communities. Coincya monensis ssp. monensis benefits from moderate disturbance by trampling, which helps to maintain open, sandy, semi-fixed dune communities, such as those dominated by Marram Grass (Ammophila arenaria). Coincya monensis ssp. monensis has been designated a scarce plant in the British flora and is a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The main threats to its conservation are loss of habitat through natural successional processes and urban development. Coincya monensis ssp. cheiranthos is well-established in South Wales where it appears to be undergoing a range expansion. At present there are no known mixed populations of the two subspecies but this remains a possibility if the alien subspecies continues to expand its range. Competition and hybridisation between subspecies in mixed populations will present additional problems in the conservation of endemic biodiversity in the British Flora.

Ecology and Management of the Western Bean Cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Corn and Dry Beans-Revision With Focus on the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT			English	Article						western bean cutworm; corn pest; dry bean pest; management; mycotoxin	ALBICOSTA SMITH LEPIDOPTERA; ECONOMIC INJURY LEVELS; MAIZE EAR ROT; RANGE EXPANSION; HYBRIDS; DAMAGE; ONTARIO; SUSCEPTIBILITY; MYCOTOXINS; FUMONISINS	The western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith) is a native North American pest of corn and dry beans. The historical geographic range of the western bean cutworm covered the western Great Plains states including Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming. Since 1999, the geographic range of the western bean cutworm has rapidly expanded eastward across the U.S. Corn Belt and eastern Canada, causing significant and economic damage to corn Zea mays (L.) and dry edible beans Phaseolus spp., in parts of this region. Since 2010, increasing challenges related to managing this pest in its new range prompted numerous research studies that provided new insights into the biology and management of western bean cutworm. This revision of a previous Journal of IPM profile summarizes new information regarding the ecology and biology of western bean cutworm, and discusses updated recommendations for scouting and management in corn and dry beans, with an emphasis in the expanded geographic range of the Great Lakes region.

Monoecious hydrilla-A review of the literature	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT			English	Review							VERTICILLATA LF ROYLE; AVIAN VACUOLAR MYELINOPATHY; DIOECIOUS HYDRILLA; GRASS CARP; SUBMERSED MACROPHYTES; HYDRELLIA-PAKISTANAE; ISOENZYME PATTERNS; ELODEA-CANADENSIS; INSECT HERBIVORY; AQUATIC PLANTS	Hydrilla verticillata is a submersed aquatic weed that has become one of most expensive and difficult to manage in the United States. It disrupts water flow, interferes with recreation, displaces native vegetation, and can negatively impact nonplant species. There are two biotypes of hydrilla found in the United States a triploid dioecious and a triploid monoecious biotype. The monoecious biotype is typically found from North Carolina northward and is rapidly spreading, whereas dioecious hydrilla is common further south and is not currently demonstrating significant range expansion. Monoecious hydrilla behaves as a herbaceous perennial with shoots senescing over winter and repopulation occurring through prolific turions. This is in contrast to dioecious hydrilla, which has more persistent stems and root crowns, but produces fewer turions. Monoecious hydrilla turions also sprout at a far greater rate under cooler temperatures than dioecious hydrilla. Differences in biology between the two U.S. biotypes have been reported in genetic profiles, with monoecious biotypes, possibly originating from hybridization between two distinct dioecious biotypes. Cryptic speciation of hydrilla biotypes is an interesting consideration that has recently been suggested, and additional research is needed on hydrilla genetic diversity worldwide to determine if this has occurred. The body of research focusing strictly on the monoecious biotype is much smaller than that of the dioecious, as reflected in the literature. Many publications on hydrilla make no mention of biotype; therefore only an educated guess can be made based on study locations to decipher biotype. Thus, as monoecious hydrilla continues to spread and now presents a distinct threat to glacial lakes, additional research focused on this biotype is needed. The impact of latitudinal climate changes on monoecious growth and competition with native plants has not been well documented. The native-species spectrum of northern U.S. lakes is different than in traditional monoecious areas. Research needs to evaluate the ecological impact of hydrilla invasion as well as best management techniques for removing monoecious hydrilla from these plant communities. In addition, although seed production of monoecious hydrilla has been reported, it is poorly understood in situ. Seed production, viability, and potential dispersal also represent areas that have not been adequately documented.

Establishment of Striacosta albicosta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) as a Primary Pest of Corn in the Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Striacosta albicosta; overwintering; monitoring; primary pest; Bt corn	WESTERN BEAN CUTWORM; BACILLUS-THURINGIENSIS TOXINS; VIRGIFERA-VIRGIFERA LECONTE; FIELD-EVOLVED RESISTANCE; ECONOMIC INJURY LEVELS; SMITH LEPIDOPTERA; FALL ARMYWORM; EAR ROT; ROOTWORM; HYBRIDS	Western bean cutworm, Stroacpsta albicosta Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a pest of corn, Zea maize L., and dry edible beans, Phaseolus sp. L., native to the western United States. Following the range expansion into the U.S. Corn Belt, pheromone trap monitoring began in the Great Lakes region in 2006.The first S. albicosta was captured in Michigan in 2006 and in Ontario, Canada in 2008. Pheromone traps were used to document spread and increasing captures of S. albicosta across Michigan and Ontario until 2012. Trapping confirmed the univoltine life cycle of S. albicosta in this region and identified peak flight, typically occurring in late July. Overwintering of S. albicosta in this region was confirmed by emergence from infested fields and overwintering experiments. Multiple soil textures were infested with prepupae, and recovery was assessed throughout the winter. Overwintering success was not affected by soil texture, however, prepupae were found at greater depths in coarse-textured soils Soil temperatures at overwintering depths did not reach the supercooling point Injury to corn by S. albicosta increased in incidence, severity and geographic range from 2010 to 2014 in field plots. Decreasing control of injury by Cry 1F corn hybrids was observed over time.These findings show that S. albicosta has established as a perennial corn pest in the Great Lakes region due to observations of overwintering success and unmanaged injury. We recommend S. albicosta obtain primary pest status in this region within regulatory framework and a resistance management plan be required for traits targeting this pest.	[Smith, J.

Analysis is targeting a 648 base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene. More than 5000 species have already been DNA barcoded, with an average of five specimens per species, typically vouchers with authoritative identifications. The barcode sequence from any fish, fillet, fin, egg or larva can be matched against these reference sequences using BOLD; the Barcode of Life Data System (http://www.barcodinglife.org). The benefits of barcoding fishes include facilitating species identification, highlighting cases of range expansion for known species, flagging previously overlooked species and enabling identifications where traditional methods cannot be applied. Results thus far indicate that barcodes separate c. 98 and 93% of already described marine and freshwater fish species, respectively. Several specimens with divergent barcode sequences have been confirmed by integrative taxonomic analysis as new species. Past concerns in relation to the use of fish barcoding for species discrimination are discussed. These include hybridization, recent radiations, regional differentiation in barcode sequences and nuclear copies of the barcode region. However, current results indicate these issues are of little concern for the great majority of specimens.	[Ward, R.

Evolutionary genomics of Culex pipiens: global and local adaptations associated with climate, life-history traits and anthropogenic factors	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Culex pipiens; selective sweeps; histones; principal component analysis; population structure; differential selection	DIPTERA-CULICIDAE MOSQUITOS; DETECTING SELECTIVE SWEEPS; BELOW-GROUND POPULATIONS; NEW-YORK-CITY; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; NATURAL-SELECTION; CHAPERONIN CCT; COLD-HARDINESS; DELIA-ANTIQUA; COMPLEX	We present the first genome-wide study of recent evolution in Culex pipiens species complex focusing on the genomic extent, functional targets and likely causes of global and local adaptations. We resequenced pooled samples of six populations of C. pipiens and two populations of the outgroup Culex torrentium. We used principal component analysis to systematically study differential natural selection across populations and developed a phylogenetic scanning method to analyse admixture without haplotype data. We found evidence for the prominent role of geographical distribution in shaping population structure and specifying patterns of genomic selection. Multiple adaptive events, involving genes implicated with autogeny, diapause and insecticide resistance were limited to specific populations. We estimate that about 5-20% of the genes (including several histone genes) and almost half of the annotated pathways were undergoing selective sweeps in each population. The high occurrence of sweeps in non-genic regions and in chromatin remodelling genes indicated the adaptive importance of gene expression changes. We hypothesize that global adaptive processes in the C. pipiens complex are potentially associated with South to North range expansion, requiring adjustments in chromatin conformation. Strong local signature of adaptation and emergence of hybrid bridge vectors necessitate genomic assessment of populations before specifying control agents.

They are also closely related sibling species that share chromosomal and molecular polymorphisms as a consequence of incomplete lineage sorting or introgressive hybridization. To help resolve these processes, this study examined the partitioning of mtDNA sequence variation within and between species across Africa, from both population genetic and phylogeographic perspectives. Based on partial gene sequences from the cytochrome b, ND1 and ND5 genes, haplotype diversity was high but sequences were very closely related. Within species, little or no population subdivision was detected, and there was no evidence for isolation by distance. Between species, there were no fixed nucleotide differences, a high proportion of shared polymorphisms, and eight haplotypes in common over distances as great as 6000 km. Only one of 16 shared polymorphisms led to an amino acid difference, and there was no compelling evidence for nonneutral variation. Parsimony networks constructed of haplotypes from both species revealed no correspondence of haplotype with either geography or taxonomy. This trend of low intraspecific genetic divergence is consistent with evidence from allozyme and microsatellite data and is interpreted in terms of both extensive gene flow and recent range expansion from relatively large, stable populations. We argue that retention of ancestral polymorphisms is a plausible but insufficient explanation for low interspecific genetic divergence, and that extensive hybridization is a contributing factor.

The Potential Distribution of Invading Helicoverpa armigera in North America: Is It Just a Matter of Time?	PLOS ONE			English	Article							NEW-SOUTH-WALES; HELIOTHIS-PUNCTIGERA WALLENGREN; LIGHT-TRAP DATA; LEPIDOPTERA-NOCTUIDAE; HUBNER LEPIDOPTERA; HOST-PLANT; COTTON BOLLWORM; INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE; SPRING EMERGENCE; SPP. LEPIDOPTERA	Helicoverpa armigera has recently invaded South and Central America, and appears to be spreading rapidly. We update a previously developed potential distribution model to highlight the global invasion threat, with emphasis on the risks to the United States. The continued range expansion of H. armigera in Central America is likely to change the invasion threat it poses to North America qualitatively, making natural dispersal from either the Caribbean islands or Mexico feasible. To characterise the threat posed by H. armigera, we collated the value of the major host crops in the United States growing within its modelled potential range, including that area where it could expand its range during favourable seasons. We found that the annual value of crops that would be exposed to H. armigera totalled approximately US$ 78 billion p.a., with US$ 843 million p.a. worth growing in climates that are optimal for the pest. Elsewhere, H. armigera has developed broad-spectrum pesticide resistance; meaning that if it invades the United States, protecting these crops from significant production impacts could be challenging. It may be cost-effective to undertake preemptive biosecurity activities such as slowing the spread of H. armigera throughout the Americas, improving the system for detecting H. armigera, and methods for rapid identification, especially distinguishing between H. armigera, H. zea and potential H. armigera x H. zea hybrids. Developing biological control programs, especially using inundative techniques with entomopathogens and parasitoids could slow the spread of H. armigera, and reduce selective pressure for pesticide resistance. The rapid spread of H. armigera through South America into Central America suggests that its spread into North America is a matter of time. The likely natural dispersal routes preclude aggressive incursion responses, emphasizing the value of preparatory communication with agricultural producers in areas suitable for invasion by H. armigera.

Recently, however, a relatively new threat to spotted owls has emerged in the form of an invasive competitor: the congeneric barred owl (S. varia). As barred owls have rapidly expanded their populations into the entire range of the northern spotted owl, mounting evidence indicates that they are displacing, hybridizing with, and even killing spotted owls. The range expansion by barred owls into western North America has made an already complex conservation issue even more contentious, and a lack of information on the ecological relationships between the 2 species has hampered recovery efforts for northern spotted owls. We investigated spatial relationships, habitat use, diets, survival, and reproduction of sympatric spotted owls and barred owls in western Oregon, USA, during 2007-2009. Our overall objective was to determine the potential for and possible consequences of competition for space, habitat, and food between these previously allopatric owl species. Our study included 29 spotted owls and 28 barred owls that were radio-marked in 36 neighboring territories and monitored over a 24-month period. Based on repeated surveys of both species, the number of territories occupied by pairs of barred owls in the 745-km(2) study area (82) greatly outnumbered those occupied by pairs of spotted owls (15). Estimates of mean size of home ranges and core-use areas of spotted owls (1,843ha and 305ha, respectively) were 2-4 times larger than those of barred owls (581ha and 188ha, respectively). Individual spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories often had overlapping home ranges, but interspecific space sharing was largely restricted to broader foraging areas in the home range with minimal spatial overlap among core-use areas. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank discrete-choice models representing alternative hypotheses about the influence of forest conditions, topography, and interspecific interactions on species-specific patterns of nighttime resource selection. Spotted owls spent a disproportionate amount of time foraging on steep slopes in ravines dominated by old (>120 yr) conifer trees. Barred owls used available forest types more evenly than spotted owls, and were most strongly associated with patches of large hardwood and conifer trees that occupied relatively flat areas along streams. Spotted and barred owls differed in the relative use of old conifer forest (greater for spotted owls) and slope conditions (steeper slopes for spotted owls), but we found no evidence that the 2 species differed in their use of young, mature, and riparian-hardwood forest types. Mean overlap in proportional use of different forest types between individual spotted owls and barred owls in adjacent territories was 81% (range=30-99%). The best model of habitat use for spotted owls indicated that the relative probability of a location being used was substantially reduced if the location was within or in close proximity to a core-use area of a barred owl. We used pellet analysis and measures of food-niche overlap to determine the potential for dietary competition between spatially associated pairs of spotted owls and barred owls. We identified 1,223 prey items from 15 territories occupied by spotted owls and 4,299 prey items from 24 territories occupied by barred owls. Diets of both species were dominated by nocturnal mammals, but diets of barred owls included many terrestrial, aquatic, and diurnal prey species that were rare or absent in diets of spotted owls. Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes, N. cinerea), and lagomorphs (Lepus americanus, Sylvilagus bachmani) were primary prey for both owl species, accounting for 81% and 49% of total dietary biomass for spotted owls and barred owls, respectively. Mean dietary overlap between pairs of spotted and barred owls in adjacent territories was moderate (42%; range=28-70%). Barred owls displayed demographic superiority over spotted owls; annual survival probability of spotted owls from known-fate analyses (0.81, SE=0.05) was lower than that of barred owls (0.92, SE=0.04), and pairs of barred owls produced an average of 4.4 times more young than pairs of spotted owls over a 3-year period. We found a strong, positive relationship between seasonal (6-month) survival probabilities of both species and the proportion of old (>120 yr) conifer forest within individual home ranges, which suggested that availability of old forest was a potential limiting factor in the competitive relationship between these 2 species. The annual number of young produced by spotted owls increased linearly with increasing distance from a territory center of a pair of barred owls, and all spotted owls that attempted to nest within 1.5km of a nest used by barred owls failed to successfully produce young. We identified strong associations between the presence of barred owls and the behavior and fitness potential of spotted owls, as shown by changes in movements, habitat use, and reproductive output of spotted owls exposed to different levels of spatial overlap with territorial barred owls. When viewed collectively, our results support the hypothesis that interference competition with barred owls for territorial space can constrain the availability of critical resources required for successful recruitment and reproduction of spotted owls. Availability of old forests and associated prey species appeared to be the most strongly limiting factors in the competitive relationship between these species, indicating that further loss of these conditions can lead to increases in competitive pressure. Our findings have broad implications for the conservation of spotted owls, as they suggest that spatial heterogeneity in vital rates may not arise solely because of differences among territories in the quality or abundance of forest habitat, but also because of the spatial distribution of a newly established competitor. Experimental removal of barred owls could be used to test this hypothesis and determine whether localized control of barred owl numbers is an ecologically practical and socio-politically acceptable management tool to consider in conservation strategies for spotted owls.
